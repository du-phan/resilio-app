## Training Paces (VDOT 46)

Based on your current fitness level:

- **E-pace (Easy)**: 6:45 - 7:15 /km
  *Use for: Easy runs, recovery runs, warm-up/cool-down*
  *Feel: Conversational, RPE 3-4*

- **M-pace (Marathon)**: 5:50 - 6:05 /km
  *Use for: Marathon pace segments (long run buildup)*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 6-7*

- **T-pace (Threshold)**: 5:25 - 5:40 /km
  *Use for: Tempo runs, cruise intervals*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 7-8*

- **I-pace (Interval)**: 5:00 - 5:15 /km
  *Use for: VO2max intervals (10K-specific speed)*
  *Feel: Hard, RPE 8-9*

- **R-pace (Repetition)**: 4:35 - 4:50 /km
  *Use for: Fast repeats (rarely used for 10K)*
  *Feel: Very hard, RPE 9-10*

**Note**: These paces are derived from your recent 10K equivalent fitness. Actual race pace will be 5:55-6:05/km (targeting sub-42:30).

## Guardrails Check

✓ **80/20 Intensity Distribution**
  - Plan maintains ~82% easy volume, ~18% quality work
  - Easy runs prescribed at E-pace (conversational)
  - Quality sessions spaced 2-3 days apart (Tuesday + Thursday alternating with easy)

✓ **Quality Volume Limits (Daniels)**
  - T-pace: 7-8% of weekly volume (well under 10% limit)
  - I-pace: 6-7% of weekly volume (under 8% limit)
  - R-pace: Not used (appropriate for 10K training)

✓ **Long Run Caps**
  - Duration: Peak long run 73 min (Week 3), 15 km (Week 7)
  - % of weekly volume: Peak 43% of weekly volume in Week 7 (acceptable for 10K)
  - Total long run volume conservative compared to marathon training

✓ **Weekly Progression (10% Rule)**
  - Average weekly increase: +6-12% during base phase (respects 10% guideline)
  - Recovery week 4 at 70% consolidates adaptations
  - No week exceeds +15% (except Week 5 increase from recovery week)

✓ **ACWR Safety**
  - Gradual buildup prevents injury risk spikes
  - Recovery weeks maintain safe ACWR
  - 8-week condensed timeline still respects load management

## Key Success Factors

1. **Easy runs MUST be easy**: E-pace means conversational (RPE 3-4). If you can't talk in full sentences, slow down.
2. **Recovery week is mandatory**: Don't skip Week 4 - it consolidates adaptations and preps you for Build phase intensity.
3. **Quality sessions done fresh**: If readiness is low on Tuesday, move tempo to Wednesday and keep Thursday easy.
4. **Long run progression is gradual**: Notice the jump from 9.5km (Week 3) to 10km (Week 5) - conservative to prevent injury.
5. **Listen to your body**: If knee soreness, IT band tightness, or unusual fatigue appears, notify immediately.

## Adaptation Strategy

**This plan will adapt dynamically** based on:
- Daily metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/readiness)
- Adaptation triggers (injury risk, fatigue, illness)
- Life events (work stress, travel, family)
- Sleep and nutrition quality

**How adaptations work**:
- I'll check metrics before each Tuesday and Thursday quality session
- If triggers detected, I'll present options (downgrade intensity, move day, proceed)
- You decide based on how you feel
- Easy Monday/Thursday runs will adapt if needed

---

## Approval

Review this plan carefully:
- Does the 8-week compressed timeline feel right for your goal?
- Are 4 runs/week manageable with your schedule?
- Is the Saturday long run timing protected?
- Does the race date work logistically?

**Once you're happy with the plan**, I'll save it to your system and we'll start Week 1 on 2026-01-06.

**If you want changes**, let me know what to adjust and I'll regenerate.
