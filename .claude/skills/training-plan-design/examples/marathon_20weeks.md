## Training Paces (VDOT 52)

Based on your competitive fitness level:

- **E-pace (Easy)**: 6:00 - 6:30 /km
  *Use for: Easy runs, recovery runs, warm-up/cool-down*
  *Feel: Conversational, RPE 3-4*

- **M-pace (Marathon)**: 5:10 - 5:25 /km
  *Use for: Marathon pace segments (long run buildup)*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 6-7*

- **T-pace (Threshold)**: 4:45 - 5:00 /km
  *Use for: Tempo runs, cruise intervals*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 7-8*

- **I-pace (Interval)**: 4:25 - 4:40 /km
  *Use for: VO2max intervals (marathon pace variation)*
  *Feel: Hard, RPE 8-9*

- **R-pace (Repetition)**: 4:00 - 4:15 /km
  *Use for: Fast repeats (rarely used for marathon)*
  *Feel: Very hard, RPE 9-10*

**Note**: These paces assume your most recent marathon equivalent fitness. Race pace will be ~4:58/km (targeting 3:30:00).

## Masters Runner Considerations (Age 52)

**Why extended base phase (9 weeks instead of 6-7)**:
1. Injury prevention priority - longer adaptation window for connective tissues
2. Age-appropriate recovery - allows full neuromuscular integration before peak loads
3. Sustainable progression - 5% weekly increase instead of aggressive 10%

**Why conservative long run progression**:
- Week 1-9 base: Long runs reach 24km (not 28-30km)
- Week 18 peak: 32km max (vs. 35-40km for younger athletes)
- Reduces impact load while maintaining marathon preparation

**Why taper is longer (3 weeks)**:
- Weeks 16-18 are "controlled peak" - high volume but slight intensity reduction
- Week 19: First taper week, significant volume drop
- Week 20: Race week - minimal running, focus on freshness

## Guardrails Check

✓ **80/20 Intensity Distribution**
  - Plan maintains ~81% easy volume, ~19% quality work
  - Easy runs at E-pace (conversational)
  - Quality sessions spaced with adequate recovery (48h between hard efforts)
  - Cross-training maintains aerobic stimulus without impact

✓ **Quality Volume Limits (Daniels)**
  - T-pace: 7-9% of weekly volume (at upper end due to marathon distance)
  - I-pace: 6-7% of weekly volume (within limits)
  - R-pace: <2% of weekly volume (rarely used)

✓ **Long Run Caps**
  - Duration: Peak 180 min (Week 18, 32km)
  - % of weekly volume: Peak 36% of weekly volume (acceptable for marathon peak)
  - Progressive: 12km→32km over 18 weeks (gradual, masters-appropriate)

✓ **Weekly Progression (5% Rule - Conservative for Age)**
  - Average increase: 5-7% during base phase
  - Base phase extended to 9 weeks (vs. 6-7 typical)
  - Recovery weeks every 4-5 weeks consolidate safely
  - Peak weeks maintain load rather than increase further

✓ **ACWR Safety**
  - Gradual buildup over 20 weeks minimizes injury risk
  - Recovery weeks maintain ACWR <1.3 in most weeks
  - Cross-training (low impact) provides stimulus without spike risk
  - Extended base allows connective tissue adaptation

## Masters Runner Success Factors

1. **Easy runs MUST be easy**: E-pace means conversational (RPE 3-4). This is even more important at age 52 - easier runs = more adaptable to training.

2. **Recovery weeks are mandatory**: Don't skip weeks 4, 9, 13 - these are when your body consolidates long-term adaptations.

3. **Quality sessions with full recovery**: 48h between hard efforts (Tempos Tuesday, Intervals Thursday). This spacing is critical for sustainable progression.

4. **Long run progression is gradual**: Notice 7% increases most weeks, not 10%. This respects age-related tissue adaptation.

5. **Cross-training maintenance**: Friday easy running or cycling provides systemic stimulus without impact load accumulation.

6. **Listen to your body carefully**: If knee soreness, hip tightness, or unusual fatigue appears, notify immediately. We have 20 weeks - no reason to push through injury signals.

7. **Sleep and nutrition priority**: At 52, these matter more than at 30. Prioritize 7-8 hours sleep and adequate protein.

## Adaptation Strategy

**This plan adapts dynamically** based on:
- Daily metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/readiness)
- Adaptation triggers (injury risk, fatigue, illness)
- Age-related factors (sleep quality, life stress, nutrition)
- Life events (travel, work stress, family)

**How adaptations work**:
- I'll check metrics before each Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday session
- If readiness is low or ACWR elevated, we can downgrade intensity or move hard sessions
- If injury signals appear, we'll reduce volume immediately
- You always have final say - this is your race prep

**Typical adjustments we can make**:
- Move tempo from Tuesday to Wednesday if recovery needed
- Reduce long run M-pace if fatigue accumulates
- Convert Friday run to easy cross-training if legs need break
- Insert additional recovery week if needed

---

## Approval

Review this plan carefully:
- Does the 20-week timeline feel right for your June 1st goal?
- Are you comfortable with the 5-day running schedule (vs. 3-4 days)?
- Does the target 3:30:00 feel achievable from your current CTL 50?
- Are the conservative progressions (5% vs. 10%) acceptable?
- Does cross-training on Friday work with your schedule?

**Once you're happy**, I'll save this plan to your system and we start Week 1 on 2026-01-13.

**If you want changes**:
- Different target time or race goal
- Reduced running frequency (4 days instead of 5)
- Modified long run schedule
- Different cross-training
- Any other adjustment

Let me know and I'll regenerate and re-present.

## Final Note

At 52, this is a fantastic time to run a marathon. You have decades of training wisdom, better pacing judgment, and patience that younger runners lack. This plan respects your experience while building fitness sustainably.

Let's aim for a strong, injury-free 20 weeks and a marathon finish you're truly proud of.
