## Training Paces (VDOT 48)

Based on your current fitness level:

- **E-pace (Easy)**: 6:20 - 6:50 /km
  *Use for: Easy runs, recovery runs, warm-up/cool-down*
  *Feel: Conversational, RPE 3-4*

- **M-pace (Marathon)**: 5:30 - 5:45 /km
  *Use for: Marathon pace segments (long run buildup)*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 6-7*

- **T-pace (Threshold)**: 5:00 - 5:15 /km
  *Use for: Tempo runs, cruise intervals*
  *Feel: Comfortably hard, RPE 7-8*

- **I-pace (Interval)**: 4:40 - 4:55 /km
  *Use for: VO2max intervals (half marathon-specific speed)*
  *Feel: Hard, RPE 8-9*

- **R-pace (Repetition)**: 4:20 - 4:35 /km
  *Use for: Fast repeats (occasionally for sharpening)*
  *Feel: Very hard, RPE 9-10*

**Note**: These paces are derived from your current CTL 44. Race pace will be ~4:15/km (targeting 1:30:00).

## Multi-Sport Integration

### Weekly Schedule Pattern

Climbing Tuesdays and Saturdays are FIXED - running workouts map around them.

**Example week (Build Phase, Week 10)**:

| Day | Running | Other Sports | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------------|-------|
| Mon | Easy run (6.5 km) | Rest | 24h recovery after Saturday climb |
| Tue | **Off** | Climbing (2 hrs, ~380 AU systemic load) | Fixed commitment |
| Wed | Tempo run (8 km: 2km E + 4km T + 2km E) | Rest | Hard session 24h after climbing |
| Thu | Easy run (6 km) | Rest | Mid-week easy |
| Fri | Intervals or speed work (6.5 km) | Rest | Second quality run, 48h after tempo |
| Sat | **Off** | Climbing (2 hrs, ~380 AU systemic load) | Fixed commitment |
| Sun | Long run (12 km, easy) | Rest | Primary long run, 24h after climb |

**Load Distribution** (estimated):
- Running: ~52% of systemic load (~420-480 AU in high weeks)
- Climbing: ~48% of systemic load (~380 AU per session, 2 sessions)
- Aligns with EQUAL priority setting

**Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
- Fixed climbing days: Tuesdays and Saturdays (non-negotiable)
- Quality running sessions (Tue/Thu) require 24h separation from climbing
- Strategy: Hard run on Wednesday (after Tuesday climb), medium-hard run on Friday
- Sunday long run always 24h after Saturday climb
- Easy Monday/Thursday runs serve as buffer days

## Weekly Breakdown (Phase 1: Base - Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Base Phase (Starting Week)
**Volume**: 25 km running
**Phase**: Base
**Focus**: Establish aerobic foundation while integrating climbing

**Workouts**:
- **Monday**: Easy run (6 km, 48 min, E-pace) - Recovery after weekend
- **Wednesday**: Tempo introduction (6 km: 2km E-pace + 2km T-pace + 2km E-pace) - Assess fitness
- **Friday**: Easy run (5 km, 40 min, E-pace) - Mid-week easy
- **Sunday**: Long run (8 km, 64 min, E-pace) - Base long run, easy effort

**Climbing**: Tue/Sat sessions continue at normal intensity

**Notes**: First week is conservative. Prioritize running consistency while maintaining climbing commitment.

---

### Week 2: Base Phase
**Volume**: 29 km running (+16%)
**Phase**: Base

**Workouts**:
- **Monday**: Easy run (6.5 km, 52 min, E-pace)
- **Wednesday**: Tempo run (7 km: 2km E + 3km T + 2km E) - Extend tempo segment
- **Friday**: Easy run (5.5 km, 44 min, E-pace)
- **Sunday**: Long run (10 km, 80 min, E-pace) - Gradual long run increase

**Notes**: Double-run days feel good. Climbing gives lower-body energy management practice.

---

### Week 3: Base Phase
**Volume**: 32 km running (+10%)
**Phase**: Base

**Workouts**:
- **Monday**: Easy run (7 km, 56 min, E-pace)
- **Wednesday**: Tempo run (7.5 km: 2km E + 3.5km T + 2km E)
- **Friday**: Easy run (6 km, 48 min, E-pace)
- **Sunday**: Long run (11.5 km, 92 min, E-pace) - Peak base long run

**Notes**: This is base phase peak. Body integrating running + climbing well. Recover through Week 4.

---

### Week 4: Recovery Week
**Volume**: 23 km running (70% of Week 3)
**Phase**: Base - Recovery

**Purpose**: Consolidate aerobic adaptations, prepare for Build phase intensity increase

**Workouts**:
- **Monday**: Easy run (5.5 km, 44 min, E-pace)
- **Wednesday**: Easy run (5.5 km, 44 min, E-pace) - No tempo this week
- **Friday**: Easy run (5.5 km, 44 min, E-pace)
- **Sunday**: Long run (6.5 km, 52 min, E-pace) - Recovery long run

**Climbing**: Continue normal intensity (climbing is separate stimulus)

**Notes**: Significantly lighter running week. You'll feel fresher by end of week for Build phase.

## Guardrails Check

✓ **80/20 Intensity Distribution**
  - Plan maintains ~80% easy volume, ~20% quality work
  - Easy runs at E-pace (conversational)
  - Quality sessions (Tue+Fri pattern in Build phase) spaced appropriately
  - Climbing is cross-training stimulus, not "easy" work

✓ **Quality Volume Limits (Daniels)**
  - T-pace: 8-9% of weekly volume (at upper limit but justified for half marathon)
  - I-pace: 7-8% of weekly volume (within limits)
  - R-pace: <3% of weekly volume (minimal use)

✓ **Long Run Caps**
  - Duration: Peak 95 minutes (Week 13)
  - % of weekly volume: Peak 29% of weekly volume (within 30% limit)
  - Conservative progression (13→16km over 13 weeks)

✓ **Weekly Progression (10% Rule)**
  - Average increase: 8-12% during Build phase (respects 10% rule)
  - Recovery weeks 4, 8, 12 at 70% consolidate adaptations
  - No week exceeds +12% progression

✓ **ACWR Safety**
  - Climbing integrates as systemic load (not injury risk spike)
  - Gradual volume buildup over 16 weeks
  - Recovery weeks prevent ACWR >1.3 in most weeks
  - Monday easy runs provide buffer after weekend climbing

## Multi-Sport Load Notes

**Why this structure works for equal-priority athletes**:
1. **Fixed climbing days reduce conflicts**: Tuesday/Saturday are protected, running works around them
2. **48-hour separation between quality runs**: Wednesday hard running, Friday medium-intensity, not back-to-back
3. **Sunday long run is 24h after climbing**: Gives legs some recovery while maintaining aerobic work
4. **Easy Monday serves as buffer**: Recovery from Saturday climb before week's hard work
5. **Climbing maintains fitness**: 2 × 2-hour climbing sessions = ~760 AU/week systemic load, meaningful fitness stimulus

**If climbing schedule changes**, we can adjust immediately using the adaptation workflow.

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Easy runs MUST be easy**: E-pace means conversational (RPE 3-4). Running easy days should feel genuinely comfortable even with climbing commitment.
2. **Recovery weeks are mandatory**: Don't skip weeks 4, 8, 12 - they're when adaptations consolidate and multi-sport fatigue clears.
3. **Quality sessions done fresh**: If climbing was particularly hard, we can move Wednesday tempo to Thursday and adjust Friday.
4. **Long run progression is gradual**: 8km→16km over 13 weeks (not aggressive - respects climbing commitment).
5. **Listen to your body**: If lower body fatigue accumulates or injury signals appear, notify immediately - we'll reduce climbing temporarily.

## Adaptation Strategy

**This plan adapts dynamically** based on:
- Daily metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/readiness)
- Climbing schedule changes or intensity variations
- Adaptation triggers (injury risk, fatigue, illness)
- Life events (work travel, family)

**How adaptations work**:
- I'll check metrics before each Wednesday/Friday quality run
- If climbing was harder than normal, we can downgrade running that week
- If readiness is low, we can move hard run to a different day
- You always have control through the ask_each_time conflict policy

---

## Approval

Review this plan carefully:
- Does the 16-week timeline feel right for your May 3rd goal?
- Are the Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun running days compatible with climbing Tue/Sat?
- Does the target 1:30:00 feel achievable from current CTL 44?
- Are you comfortable with the multi-sport load distribution?

**Once you're happy**, I'll save this plan to your system and we start Week 1 on 2026-01-06.

**If you want changes**, let me know: different long run day, modified climbing schedule, adjusted intensity distribution, etc. I'll regenerate and re-present.
