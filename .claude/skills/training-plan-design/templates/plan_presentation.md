**Purpose**: Final fitness sharpening before taper

---

### Weeks 15-16: Taper Phase
[Summary format]

**Taper structure**:
- Week 15: [X] km (70% of peak) - Reduced volume, maintain intensity
- Week 16 (Race week): [X] km (40% of peak) - Easy runs + race-pace strides

**Race week schedule**:
- Mon/Tue: Easy runs (30 min)
- Wed: Rest
- Thu: Easy run (20 min) + 4 × 200m race-pace strides
- Fri: Rest
- Sat: [RACE DAY]
- Sun: Easy recovery jog (optional)

---

## Guardrails Check

✓ **80/20 Intensity Distribution**
  - Plan maintains ~80% easy volume, ~20% quality work
  - Easy runs prescribed at E-pace (conversational)
  - Quality sessions spaced 2-3 days apart

✓ **Quality Volume Limits (Daniels)**
  - T-pace: ≤10% of weekly volume
  - I-pace: ≤8% of weekly volume
  - R-pace: ≤5% of weekly volume (rarely used)

✓ **Long Run Caps**
  - Duration: ≤150 minutes (2.5 hours)
  - % of weekly volume: ≤30%
  - Peak long run: [X] km ([Y] minutes) = [Z]% of week's volume

✓ **Weekly Progression (10% Rule)**
  - Average weekly increase: [X]% during base phase
  - No week exceeds +10% (except after recovery weeks)
  - Recovery weeks every 4th week during base/build

✓ **ACWR Safety**
  - No week triggers ACWR >1.5 risk zone
  - Gradual buildup prevents injury risk spikes
  - Recovery weeks maintain ACWR <1.3

## Multi-Sport Integration

[This section only if athlete has other sports]

### Weekly Schedule Pattern

**Example week (Build Phase)**:

| Day | Running | Other Sports | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------------|-------|
| Mon | Rest    | [Sport/activity] | [Notes] |
| Tue | [Workout] | [Sport/activity] | [Notes about timing/interaction] |
| Wed | [Workout] | Rest | [Notes] |
| Thu | [Workout] | [Sport/activity] | [Notes] |
| Fri | Rest | [Sport/activity] | [Notes] |
| Sat | [Workout] | [Sport/activity or Rest] | [Notes] |
| Sun | [Workout] | Rest | [Notes] |

**Load Distribution** (estimated):
- Running: ~[X]% of systemic load
- [Other sport]: ~[Y]% of systemic load
- Aligns with [PRIMARY/EQUAL/SECONDARY] priority setting

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Fixed [other sport] days: [Days]
- Running workouts mapped around these commitments
- Easy runs 24 hours after [other sport]
- Quality runs 48 hours after hard [other sport] sessions

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **Easy runs MUST be easy**: E-pace means conversational (RPE 3-4). If you can't talk in full sentences, slow down.
2. **Recovery weeks are mandatory**: Don't skip them - they consolidate adaptations.
3. **Quality sessions done fresh**: If readiness is low or ACWR elevated, downgrade or move workout.
4. **Long run progression is gradual**: +10-15 min every 2-3 weeks (not every week).
5. **Listen to your body**: If injury signals appear, adjust immediately.

---

## Adaptation Strategy

**This plan will adapt dynamically** based on:
- Daily metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/readiness)
- Adaptation triggers (injury risk, fatigue, illness)
- Life events (travel, work stress, family)
- Multi-sport schedule changes

**How adaptations work**:
- I'll check metrics before each workout
- If triggers detected, I'll present options (downgrade, move, proceed)
- You decide based on how you feel
- Plan updates automatically to reflect changes

---

## Questions?

Review this plan carefully. Consider:
- Does the volume progression feel manageable?
- Do the training days work with your schedule?
- Are the long run durations realistic?
- Does the taper timing feel right?

**Once you're happy with the plan**:
- I'll save it to your training system
- We'll start Week 1 on [START_DATE]
- I'll provide daily recommendations based on this structure

**If you want changes**:
- Let me know what to adjust
- I'll regenerate and re-present
- We'll iterate until it feels right

## Approval

What would you like to do?

1. **Approve as-is** → I'll save this plan to your system
2. **Request modifications** → Tell me what to change
3. **Ask questions** → I'm happy to explain any part in detail
