# Periodization Quick Reference

Periodization structures training into distinct phases, each with specific adaptations. Based on Pfitzinger's _Advanced Marathoning_ and Daniels' _Running Formula_.

## Phase Structure (Pfitzinger Model)

### 1. Base Phase
**Duration**: 45-50% of total training weeks
**Purpose**: Build aerobic foundation, increase volume gradually
**Intensity**: Mostly easy runs (80-90%), minimal hard work
**Volume**: Progressive buildup from current CTL-based starting point

**Characteristics**:
- All runs at easy pace (E-pace)
- Long run increases 10-15 min every 2-3 weeks
- Recovery week every 4th week (70% volume)
- No race-specific work yet

**CTL targets**: +2-4 points per week during base

### 2. Build Phase
**Duration**: 30-35% of total training weeks
**Purpose**: Add race-specific intensity, maintain volume
**Intensity**: Mix of easy (70-75%) and quality work (25-30%)
**Volume**: Peak volume reached mid-build

**Characteristics**:
- Introduce tempo runs (T-pace)
- Add intervals (I-pace for 10K and shorter, M-pace for half/marathon)
- Long runs with quality segments
- Recovery week every 4th week

**CTL targets**: +1-2 points per week during build (slower progression due to intensity)

### 3. Peak Phase
**Duration**: 10-15% of total training weeks
**Purpose**: Maximum training load, sharpening
**Intensity**: Balanced easy (65-70%) and quality (30-35%)
**Volume**: Highest weekly volume + intensity

**Characteristics**:
- Peak week(s) with maximum volume
- Race-pace workouts frequent
- Tempo + intervals in same week
- No recovery weeks (maintain load)

**CTL targets**: Hold steady or +1 point (peak fitness)

### 4. Taper Phase
**Duration**: 8-12% of total training weeks (typically 2-3 weeks)
**Purpose**: Reduce fatigue, maintain fitness, peak for race day
**Intensity**: Maintain intensity (keep race-pace workouts), reduce volume
**Volume**: Progressive reduction (70% → 50% → 40% of peak)

**Characteristics**:
- Week 1: 70% volume, maintain intensity
- Week 2: 50% volume, shorter quality sessions
- Race week: 40% volume, easy runs + race-pace strides
- TSB target: +5 to +15 (race ready)

**CTL targets**: Slight decline (-2 to -4 points total) acceptable for freshness

## Phase Allocation Calculation

### Standard Allocation Percentages

Divide weeks into phases (base, build, peak, taper) using race distance and weeks available.

**Standard allocation**:
- **Base**: 45-50% of total weeks (aerobic foundation)
- **Build**: 30-35% of total weeks (race-specific intensity)
- **Peak**: 10-15% of total weeks (maximum load)
- **Taper**: 8-12% of total weeks (recover, peak fitness)

**Recovery weeks**: Every 4th week during base/build at 70% volume (not during peak/taper).

### Distance-Specific Adjustments

**Marathon-specific**:
- Extend base phase by +1-2 weeks (aerobic foundation is critical)
- Longer taper: 3 weeks (recovery from high volume training)
- Reason: Longer race demands deeper aerobic base and more recovery time

**10K-specific**:
- Shorter base phase (aerobic base develops faster)
- No separate peak phase (merge peak into final build weeks)
- Shorter taper: 1 week (less accumulated fatigue)
- Reason: Shorter race allows faster progression to intensity

**Calculation example** (16-week half marathon):
- Base: 16 × 0.47 = 7.5 weeks → 7 weeks (weeks 1-7)
- Build: 16 × 0.31 = 5.0 weeks → 5 weeks (weeks 8-12)
- Peak: 16 × 0.12 = 1.9 weeks → 2 weeks (weeks 13-14)
- Taper: 16 × 0.10 = 1.6 weeks → 2 weeks (weeks 15-16)

**Rounding rule**: Round to nearest whole week, prioritize base phase if rounding needed.

## Phase Allocation Examples

### 10K (8-12 weeks)
- Base: 4 weeks (50%)
- Build: 3-4 weeks (38%)
- Peak: 1 week (12%)
- Taper: 1 week (12% - race week only)

### Half Marathon (12-16 weeks)
- Base: 6-7 weeks (47%)
- Build: 4-5 weeks (31%)
- Peak: 1-2 weeks (12%)
- Taper: 2 weeks (16%)

### Marathon (16-20 weeks)
- Base: 8-9 weeks (47%)
- Build: 5-6 weeks (31%)
- Peak: 2 weeks (12%)
- Taper: 2-3 weeks (16%)

**Rule**: Longer races → longer base, longer taper

---

## Recovery Week Placement

### When to Schedule
- Every 4th week during **base** and **build** phases
- NOT during peak phase (maintaining load)
- NOT during taper (already reducing volume)

### Recovery Week Structure
- **Volume**: 70% of previous week
- **Intensity**: Maintain intensity, reduce frequency
- **Example**: If Week 3 = 50 km with tempo + long run
  - Week 4 = 35 km (70%) with tempo (shorter) + long run (shorter)
  - Keep intensity zones same, reduce duration

### Purpose
- Consolidate adaptations from previous 3 weeks
- Allow body to supercompensate
- Prevent overtraining accumulation
- Prepare for next 3-week build cycle

## Multi-Sport Considerations

### Running Priority = PRIMARY
- Follow standard periodization
- Other sports supplement, don't replace key runs
- Example: Climbing on non-run days, cycling for cross-training

### Running Priority = EQUAL
- Coordinate phases with other sport's season
- Base phase: Higher volume in other sport, lower running volume
- Build phase: Balance intensity across both sports
- Example: Climbing season → reduce running to 2-3x/week during base

### Running Priority = SECONDARY
- Minimal periodization (running supports other sport)
- Maintain base fitness year-round
- No peak phase (focus is on primary sport's peak)
- Example: Competitive climber → 2 easy runs/week to maintain cardio

## Age Adjustments (Masters 45+)

### Recovery Week Frequency
- **Under 45**: Every 4th week (standard)
- **45-54**: Consider every 3rd week
- **55-64**: Every 3rd week recommended
- **65+**: Every 2-3rd week

### Phase Duration
- Extend base phase (+1-2 weeks)
- Shorter peak phase (-1 week)
- Standard taper (don't extend)

### Volume Progression
- More conservative (+5-7% vs +10% per week)
- Longer adaptation periods between progressions

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping base**: Starting with intervals too soon → injury risk
2. **No recovery weeks**: 8+ weeks of continuous building → overtraining
3. **Peak too long**: >2 weeks at peak load → fatigue accumulation
4. **Taper too long**: >3 weeks → detraining
5. **Taper too short**: <1 week → racing fatigued
