## Factors Affecting Readiness

**Biological**:
- Sleep quality (duration and depth)
- Resting heart rate (elevated = low readiness)
- Immune system status (illness, stress)

**Training**:
- Recent training load (TSB)
- Muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Cumulative fatigue

**Psychological**:
- Subjective wellness (mood, energy)
- Stress levels (work, life)
- Motivation

## Using Readiness as a Gate

**Key principle**: Readiness acts as a secondary safety check beyond ACWR.

**Decision logic**:
- Readiness <50 → **No quality workouts**, even if ACWR safe
- Readiness >70 + ACWR safe → **Green light** for quality
- Readiness 50-70 + ACWR safe → **Proceed with caution**, consider shorter/easier version

**Example**: ACWR 1.05 (safe) but readiness 38 (very low) → Skip quality workout, do easy run or rest.
