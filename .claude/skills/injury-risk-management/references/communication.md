# Risk Communication

Techniques for explaining injury risk to athletes.

## Visualization: Risk Trajectory Narrative

When presenting risk to athlete, use narrative to create a mental model rather than just showing numbers.

**Example**:
> "Think of your training load as a curve. Your CTL (fitness) is climbing steadily at 44. Your ATL (fatigue) spiked to 58 this week due to the long run + climbing comp. The gap between these two numbers gives us ACWR: 58 ÷ 44 = 1.32.
>
> When ACWR is 0.8-1.3, your body adapts well. When it crosses 1.3, injury risk increases because fatigue is outpacing your body's ability to recover.
>
> Right now, you're at 1.32 - just over the threshold. One more hard week would push you to 1.4-1.5 (high risk). But if we back off slightly this week, you'll drop back to 1.15 by next week, and we can resume normal progression safely."

## Key Elements of Effective Risk Communication

### 1. Explain What Metrics Mean
Don't just state numbers - explain what they represent in plain language.

**Bad**: "Your ACWR is 1.32"
**Good**: "Your ACWR is 1.32 - this means your recent training load is 32% higher than your body is adapted to"

### 2. Show the Trend
Explain where they're heading, not just where they are now.

**Example**: "If we continue this pattern, ACWR will reach 1.5 by next week (high injury risk zone)"

### 3. Connect to Injury Risk
Make the "why it matters" explicit.

**Example**: "Research shows ACWR above 1.3 increases injury risk by 1.5-2x compared to baseline"

### 4. Provide Clear Action
Give specific, actionable recommendations with rationale.

**Example**: "I recommend reducing this week's volume to 35km (down from 42km). This brings ACWR back to 1.15 by next week while maintaining your fitness trajectory."

## Adaptation by Risk Level

**Low risk**: Brief reassurance + monitoring plan
**Moderate risk**: Explain concern + present options + get buy-in
**High risk**: Directive recommendation + explain consequences + minimal optionality
**Very high risk**: Strong directive + emphasize injury prevention over short-term goals
