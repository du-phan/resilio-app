# ACWR Risk Zones

Detailed ACWR zone definitions with injury risk multipliers.

---

| ACWR Range | Zone | Injury Risk | Action Required | Example Scenario |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0.5-0.8 | Undertraining | Low injury, high detraining risk | Increase load gradually | Returning from break, CTL dropping |
| 0.8-1.0 | Low-normal | Baseline risk | Continue, monitor trends | Steady training, no spikes |
| 1.0-1.15 | Optimal | Baseline risk | Continue, good adaptation zone | Progressive buildup during base phase |
| 1.15-1.3 | Safe-high | Baseline risk | Monitor closely, no action unless sustained | Post-recovery week, temporary spike |
| 1.3-1.4 | Caution | 1.5x baseline risk | Proactive adjustment within 3-7 days | Volume increased 12%, feeling good |
| 1.4-1.5 | High caution | 2x baseline risk | Immediate adjustment (downgrade or rest) | Back-to-back hard weeks, no recovery |
| >1.5 | Danger | 2-4x baseline risk | Immediate rest or drastic reduction | Sudden volume spike, illness return |

## Key Insight

**ACWR 1.3 is the inflection point** where injury risk starts climbing significantly. Prevention is most effective at 1.15-1.3 (before entering danger zone).

**Research basis**: Studies show injury risk increases exponentially beyond ACWR 1.3, with 2-4x baseline risk at ACWR >1.5.
