### Phase
- **Current phase**: [Phase name]
- **Weeks in phase**: [X] / [Y total]
- **Phase-specific emphasis**: [Aerobic base building / Lactate threshold development / VO2max work / Race-specific intensity / Taper and recovery]

### Workout Focus
- **Emphasis shift**: [e.g., "Adding more M-pace segments to long runs" / "Increasing tempo run duration" / "Introducing interval sessions"]
- **New workout types**: [If any new session types introduced]
- **Discontinued workouts**: [If any workout types being phased out]
