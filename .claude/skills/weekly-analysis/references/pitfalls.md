# Common Pitfalls in Weekly Analysis

## Overview

Weekly analysis is both **data-driven** (metrics, adherence, intensity) and **relationship-driven** (trust, encouragement, communication). Avoid these common coaching mistakes.

---

## Pitfall 1: Focusing Only on Negatives

### The Mistake
Leading with criticism and problems without acknowledging achievements.

### ❌ Bad Example
```
You missed 2 workouts this week. Your ACWR is elevated to 1.35, which puts you at higher injury risk. Your intensity distribution is also off - you're running easy runs too hard at RPE 6.
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Demoralizing - athlete feels like they failed
- Misses positive patterns worth reinforcing
- Can damage coaching relationship
- May reduce athlete motivation

### ✅ Good Example
```
Solid week! You nailed all your quality sessions (tempo and intervals), and your long run was your best yet.

Two things to fine-tune for next week:
1. Let's slow down easy run pace to 6:45-7:15/km (currently running 6:00/km)
2. Watch ACWR - it's at 1.35, so we'll hold volume steady this week

Overall: Strong training, just need to dial in the easy pace and let your body adapt to the current load.
```

**Why it's good**:
- Starts with positive reinforcement
- Acknowledges athlete effort and success
- Frames concerns as "fine-tuning" not "failures"
- Maintains motivation and trust

### The Principle
**Start with what went well. Then address concerns as opportunities for improvement.**

## Pitfall 2: Not Contextualizing Adherence

### The Mistake
Judging adherence percentage without understanding *why* it was low.

### ❌ Bad Example
```
You only completed 60% of your planned workouts this week. We need better commitment to the plan if you want to reach your goal.
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Assumes low adherence = lack of commitment
- Ignores life context (work, family, illness, injury)
- Can feel accusatory
- Misses the actual problem

### ✅ Good Example
```
You completed 60% of planned workouts this week - I see you noted "work travel" on Tuesday-Thursday. That explains the missed runs.

Here's what I noticed:
- When you *were* able to train (Fri-Sun), quality was excellent
- Your Saturday long run was strong despite the disrupted week
- You adapted well to the constraint

For next week, do you know your travel schedule in advance? If so, we can adjust the plan proactively rather than missing sessions.
```

**Why it's good**:
- Acknowledges the context (travel)
- Separates circumstances from effort
- Highlights what athlete did accomplish
- Problem-solves for future (proactive planning)

### The Principle
**Low adherence is information about constraints, not a judgment on commitment. Investigate before interpreting.**

## Pitfall 3: Ignoring 80/20 Violations

### The Mistake
Skipping intensity distribution analysis or not flagging moderate-intensity rut.

### ❌ Bad Example
```
Your training looks good this week. You hit all your planned workouts and your volume is on track. Keep it up!
```

**Why it's bad** (if intensity was actually 65/35):
- Misses the #1 mistake recreational athletes make
- Moderate-intensity rut leads to chronic fatigue
- Athlete thinks they're doing it right
- Problem compounds over weeks

### ✅ Good Example
```
Training looks good overall - you hit all planned workouts and volume is on track.

One adjustment needed: Your intensity distribution was 65/35 this week (should be ~80/20). Here's what happened:

- Tuesday easy: 6:00/km → RPE 6 (should be RPE 3-4 at 6:45-7:15/km)
- Thursday easy: 5:45/km → RPE 6 (should be RPE 3-4)

This "moderate-intensity rut" is super common - everything ends up at medium effort. The fix is simple: slow down your easy runs to conversational pace. It will feel "too slow" at first, but it's critical for:
1. Recovery between quality sessions
2. Building aerobic base
3. Injury prevention
4. Long-term performance gains

Let's nail this next week - aim for 6:45-7:15/km on easy days.
```

**Why it's good**:
- Flags the violation with specific data
- Explains *why* it matters (not just "because 80/20")
- Provides concrete pace targets
- Normalizes the mistake ("super common")
- Gives athlete a clear action

### The Principle
**Proactively flag moderate-intensity rut - it's the most common training mistake and the easiest to fix.**

## Pitfall 4: Not Synthesizing Multi-Sport Data

### The Mistake
Treating running and other sports as separate silos instead of connected load sources.

### ❌ Bad Example
```
You ran 40 km this week. You also climbed 3 times. Your ACWR is 1.32, which is elevated.
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Doesn't connect the dots
- Athlete doesn't understand *why* ACWR spiked
- Misses the multi-sport interaction
- May blame running volume when climbing contributed

### ✅ Good Example
```
You ran 40 km this week (as planned) and climbed 3 times (up from your usual 2 sessions). Here's the load breakdown:

- Running: 850 AU systemic load
- Climbing: 480 AU systemic load (20% increase from last week)
- Total: 1,330 AU (combined load)

This combined load drove your ACWR from 1.15 → 1.32 (caution zone). The culprit wasn't running volume - it was the extra climbing session adding 160 AU on top of your planned running.

For next week:
- If you want to keep 3 climbing sessions, reduce running volume to 35 km
- Or revert to 2 climbing sessions and keep running at 40 km
- Either way, we need to cap total load to let ACWR normalize

Which sounds better for your schedule?
```

**Why it's good**:
- Shows the complete load picture
- Explains cause-and-effect (extra climbing → ACWR spike)
- Provides athlete with options
- Respects multi-sport lifestyle
- Uses data to inform trade-offs

### The Principle
**Connect the dots between all sports. Multi-sport athletes need to see how activities interact to understand load management.**

## Pitfall 5: Generic Recommendations

### The Mistake
Giving vague advice without concrete actions or numbers.

### ❌ Bad Example
```
Try to stick to the plan next week. Make sure you're running your easy runs easy. Watch your ACWR and don't overtrain.
```

**Why it's bad**:
- No specific actions
- No measurable targets
- Athlete doesn't know what to *do* differently
- "Don't overtrain" is not actionable

### ✅ Good Example
```
For next week:
1. **Easy run pace**: Slow down to 6:45-7:15/km (currently 6:00/km). Check: You should be able to talk in full sentences.
2. **Volume cap**: Keep weekly total at 40 km maximum (don't increase from this week)
3. **ACWR monitoring**: If ACWR reaches 1.3 or higher on Wednesday, reduce Friday tempo to easy run
4. **Climbing schedule**: Stick to 2 sessions (not 3) to manage total load

**Primary focus**: Nail the easy run pace. This one change will improve recovery and intensity distribution.
```

**Why it's good**:
- Specific pace targets (6:45-7:15/km)
- Concrete volume limit (40 km max)
- Conditional action (if ACWR ≥1.3, adjust Friday)
- Clear priority (easy run pace)
- Athlete knows exactly what to do

### The Principle
**Specific, actionable recommendations with concrete numbers. If the athlete can't measure it, it's not actionable.**

## Self-Check Questions

Before sending weekly analysis, ask yourself:

1. ✅ Did I start with something positive?
2. ✅ Did I investigate *why* adherence was low (if applicable)?
3. ✅ Did I check intensity distribution and flag violations?
4. ✅ Did I show total load across all sports?
5. ✅ Are my recommendations specific with concrete numbers?

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise before sending.
