# Edge Cases

Handling unusual race preparation situations.

---

## Edge Case 1: Race Canceled or Postponed

**Problem**: Race canceled 1 week before due to weather/COVID/etc.

**Action**:
1. Assess athlete's options:
   - Option A: Find replacement race within 2-3 weeks
   - Option B: Time trial (solo race effort on measured course)
   - Option C: Return to training (reverse taper, rebuild CTL)

2. If no replacement race:
   - Week 1: Easy running (maintain taper volume)
   - Week 2: Gradual return to pre-taper volume
   - Week 3+: Resume normal training

**Key**: Don't let peak fitness go to waste - time trial or replacement race preferred

## Edge Case 2: Illness in Final Week

**Problem**: Athlete gets cold 5 days before race.

**Decision tree**:
- **Fever**: DNS (do not start) - racing with fever risks serious illness
- **Above neck** (sniffles, sore throat): Possible to race, expectations adjusted
- **Below neck** (chest congestion, body aches): DNS recommended

**If racing with minor illness**:
- Adjust goals (B-goal or C-goal)
- Conservative pacing (no A-goal attempts)
- Monitor during race (stop if feeling worse)

## Edge Case 3: Injury Flare-Up in Taper

**Problem**: Old injury (e.g., IT band) flares 10 days before race.

**Action**:
1. Rest completely until pain-free (may sacrifice some fitness for health)
2. Cross-train if possible (pool running, cycling)
3. Race day decision:
   - Pain-free with running: Proceed (adjusted goals)
   - Pain persists: DNS (long-term health > single race)

**Use AskUserQuestion** to discuss priorities (race vs long-term health)

## Edge Case 4: Over-Tapered (TSB +22, CTL dropped 6 points)

**Problem**: Athlete rested too much, lost sharpness.

**Action** (if >5 days to race):
- Add 1-2 short tempo runs (20-30min at T-pace)
- Include race-pace strides
- Increase easy run volume slightly

**Action** (if <5 days to race):
- Too late to fix, adjust expectations
- Focus on executing race plan within current fitness
- Post-race: Learn lesson for next taper
