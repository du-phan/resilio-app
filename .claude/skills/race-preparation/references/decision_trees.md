# Decision Trees

Decision logic for race preparation scenarios.

## Q: TSB is projected +18 (very fresh). Over-tapered?

**Factors to consider**:
1. **How many days to race?**
   - 7+ days: Add short tempo or race-pace strides (increase TSB load slightly)
   - 3-5 days: Add easy run with strides
   - 1-2 days: Too late to adjust, trust fitness

2. **Is CTL stable?**
   - If CTL stable: Over-rested but fitness intact, should be fine
   - If CTL declining: Lost fitness, race expectations should adjust

3. **How does athlete feel?**
   - Feeling sluggish: Over-rested, add short sharp run
   - Feeling bouncy: Good sign, likely OK

**Decision**: If >5 days to race and CTL stable, add 1 short quality session (20min tempo or race-pace strides). If <5 days, proceed with current plan.

## Q: Readiness is declining during taper (was 72, now 58). Why?

**Common causes**:
1. **Illness brewing**: Check for cold symptoms, elevated resting HR
2. **Poor sleep**: Stress, travel, pre-race nerves
3. **Under-fueling**: Athlete cut calories during taper (bad idea)
4. **Over-taper**: Boredom, loss of routine

**Action**:
- Illness: Extra rest, consider DNS if severe
- Sleep: Sleep hygiene coaching, relaxation techniques
- Under-fueling: Increase carbs, ensure adequate calories
- Over-taper: Add short easy run to maintain routine

## Q: Athlete feels great but TSB is still negative (-3) with 3 days to race. Proceed?

**Risk assessment**:
- **5K/10K**: Acceptable (short races tolerate slight fatigue)
- **Half Marathon**: Borderline (may struggle in final 5K)
- **Marathon**: Risky (likely to hit wall earlier)

**Decision**:
- If feeling great + readiness >75: Proceed (subjective trumps metric for short races)
- If any doubt: Extra rest day, aim for TSB 0-+5 minimum
- Adjust race expectations slightly (B-goal instead of A-goal)

## Q: Should race-pace strides be included in taper?

**Yes** - for sharpness and race-pace feel:
- 5K/10K: 4-6 × 200m at race pace, 2-3 days before race
- Half Marathon: 4-5 × 200m at M-pace (race pace), 3-4 days before race
- Marathon: Optional - some athletes skip, others do 3-4 × 200m M-pace 4-5 days before

**Purpose**: Maintain leg turnover, remind body of race pace, build confidence

**Caution**: Don't overdo volume - strides are <5% of weekly volume during taper
