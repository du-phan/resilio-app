# Common Taper Mistakes

Five common mistakes athletes make during taper.

---

## Mistake 1: Training Through Taper

**Symptom**: CTL rising during taper, TSB staying negative

**Cause**: Athlete doesn't trust taper, keeps training hard

**Fix**: Explain taper science - fitness maintains for 2-3 weeks, rest allows expression of fitness

**Messaging**: "You can't gain fitness in the final 2 weeks, but you CAN arrive too tired to perform. Trust the taper."

## Mistake 2: Complete Rest (Couch Taper)

**Symptom**: CTL dropping >5 points, TSB >+20

**Cause**: Athlete rests completely (no running at all)

**Fix**: Easy short runs maintain routine, prevent staleness

**Messaging**: "Taper is reduced volume, not elimination. Short easy runs keep you sharp."

---

## Mistake 3: Pre-Race Jitters (Unnecessary Workouts)

**Symptom**: Athlete adds extra tempo or long run 5 days before race

**Cause**: Lack of confidence, fear of "losing fitness"

**Fix**: Reassure with data (CTL stable, TSB trending positive)

**Messaging**: "Your CTL is 52, same as 2 weeks ago. Your fitness is intact. Extra work now only adds fatigue."

## Mistake 4: Carb Depletion Before Carb Load

**Some athletes**: Deplete glycogen (low-carb 2-3 days) before carb loading

**Problem**: Outdated method, leaves athlete depleted if done incorrectly

**Recommendation**: Skip depletion, just increase carbs 3 days before race (8-10g/kg)

## Mistake 5: New Gear on Race Day

**Problem**: New shoes, new shorts, new anything = blister/chafing risk

**Rule**: "Nothing new on race day"

**Fix**: Test all gear in training (including race outfit, nutrition, watch settings)
