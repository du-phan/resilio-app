# Taper Trajectories

Distance-specific TSB trajectories for proper taper execution.

## 5K/10K (7-10 day taper)

**Start**: TSB -5 to -10
**Race day**: TSB +5 to +10
**Strategy**: Maintain intensity, reduce volume 40-50%

**Typical progression**:
- Day 7-10 before: TSB -8
- Day 5-6 before: TSB -2
- Day 3-4 before: TSB +3
- Race day: TSB +8

## Half Marathon (10-14 day taper)

**Start**: TSB -10 to -15
**Race day**: TSB +8 to +12
**Strategy**: Reduce volume 50-60%, maintain some intensity

**Typical progression**:
- Day 10-14 before: TSB -12
- Day 7-9 before: TSB -5
- Day 4-6 before: TSB +2
- Day 2-3 before: TSB +6
- Race day: TSB +10

## Marathon (14-21 day taper)

**Start**: TSB -15 to -20
**Race day**: TSB +10 to +15
**Strategy**: Gradual volume reduction, minimal intensity

**Typical progression**:
- Day 14-21 before: TSB -18
- Day 10-13 before: TSB -10
- Day 7-9 before: TSB -3
- Day 4-6 before: TSB +4
- Day 2-3 before: TSB +8
- Race day: TSB +12

## Key Principle

TSB should climb gradually and consistently. If TSB plateaus or declines during taper, athlete is training too hard.
