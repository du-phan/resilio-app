# Training Plan Design (Deprecated)

This skill is deprecated in favor of the split, non-interactive executor skills:

- `vdot-baseline-proposal` (produce baseline VDOT + review doc)
- `macro-plan-create` (create macro plan + review doc)

All athlete dialogue and approvals must occur in the main agent.
