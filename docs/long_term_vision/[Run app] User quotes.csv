https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/comments/1kr2zgp/struggling_to_combine_running_with_other_sports/,I love to run but I don't want to do it so often that I stop loving it lol if that makes sense,
,"I also struggled somehow combining running, road cycling, strength training and pole dance and had to take a step back and remind myself that I run for fun even when I‘m training for a race. I switched back to running two times a week and I honestly see no difference in how fast or slow I improve. But that might be because with road cycling I‘m also doing cardio training so I do have 3-4 cardio sessions a week even if I‘m only running twice a week. Sometimes I also do a running session and a strength or pole dance session a day. And I do my best to have at least 1 rest day.",
https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1dcr50y/how_do_i_find_the_perfect_pilates_x_strength_x/,"I’ve settled into a 2-2-2 routine. Two days Pilates, two days strength and two days running.I want to increase running though as I train for a race so might incorporate it into my Pilates days :)",
,"I’m focusing on running atm bc I’m starting to train for my first marathon. I’ve been doing Pilates for almost a year now and love it! I’m also trying to add in some strength training to benefit both running and Pilates. I’ve been playing around with how I go about scheduling but on average this is what I end up doing: 
M: Pilates class Tu: Easy run + full body strength W: Medium distance run Th: Effort run (tempo, speed or hill workout) + Lower body F: Rest, sometimes a walk or a 30 minute yoga or Pilates session Sa: Long run Su: Cross training - I switch this up to whatever I’m feeling atm but I try to make most of them focus on full body strength. I have class pass so I switch between boxing, a row class, Solidcore or more Pilates. 
I’ll switch around the days depending on what I have going on with work and life in general but this is roughly what I end up doing!",
,"Balancing workouts can be tricky, especially when they are so different from each other. That being said, I think the fact they are different can work to your advantage, as they tend to work different muscle groups and you can even combine them into one workout. For example, after a run you can do a shortened yoga routine. Or incorporate some running before your strength training. 
Also, you should set out what your goals are (maintaining/ increasing strength with weight targets, ability to do a set stretching routine, running endurance times or just to enjoy it all!). These should kind of guide what you will be focusing on in your workouts. Of course, once you complete one goal, you can move onto the next but it is generally useful to have one or two overarching aims. 
I used to make the mistake of overtraining when I first started. Listen to your body and have adequate rest days not only planned in to your weekly schedule, but also take spontaneous ones if you feel like you need them. The last thing you want is an injury that will take you back to square 1 of your goal.",
,"A good place to start is to determine if you have any training priorities. For me, I’m training for a half marathon so my running volume is quite high, and lifting and Pilates are scaled down a bit. I’m running 5-6 times a week, lifting 3x, and Pilates 1x. This gives me three double workout days so that I can have one full rest day per week where I don’t do any workouts (besides walking my dog).
Similarly, if my priority was muscle / strength gain, I’d probably go back to my usual 5x lifting routine, run 2-3 times a week at much lower mileage, and try to do Pilates twice a week.
If you don’t have any performance goals / just want to maintain, a happy medium is probably 3-4x lifting/2-3x running/1-2x Pilates. I personally find this approach really hard bc I like my weeks planned out and having a performance goal makes it easier to plan things out.",
https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/comments/1nj67ou/how_do_you_guys_incorporate_strength_training/,"Since getting back into serious running, gym gas taken a complete backseat and going only once a week. Even that gets missed very frequently. Reason - soreness from previous runs. For ex, yesterday 800s into 400s kinda ripped me apart and can’t even imaging any sort of lower body workouts today.",
,"Ive only been regularly strength training for a couple of months but I try and commit to two days a week strength (usually Monday/Friday) and 4/5 running with one full rest day. One gym day is heavy lifting and one isn’t but I don’t push to my limits in my gym sessions and workouts are usually 25-45mins. I usually one do speed session for the week on a Wednesday to minimise soreness. I think you have to be realistic with how many times a week you go and if running is your priority, don’t go too crazy in the gym!",
https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/comments/1k9qseq/how_do_you_manage_your_training_plan_if_you_also/,"Side note, I definitely wish Runna would add this as a feature! I go to run club once a week and an intense cross training workout 3x a week and I wish I could tell Runna about them and have it incorporate and/or plan around those!
",
,"I also wish they’d incorporate this!
Those methods are all good workarounds but my favourite part of Runna is the pace estimations and predicted race times and if I’m doing runs that are extra then it won’t take those into account with my predicted times. So overall it will train me up for a slower race than if it knew about the club runs I was doing too.",
https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/comments/1ikhe56/how_to_create_a_plan_for_alternating_between_2/,"I’m finishing up my current plan in 2 weeks (2 runs a week) and after that I would like to transition to 3 runs a week for my next plan (which should be of 10 weeks at least). However, at first I might not always have time for more than 2 a week (I also strength train at a gym twice a week and will be moving during that time).",
https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/7pdqhu/experiences_training_multiple_athletic,"I'm at the stage of slowly building things up right now, but I can tell you how it went for me in the past. I built up one activity to 3x per week, a second activity to 2x per week, then added running 3x per week into the mix. (That took about 5 months). Then I gradually built up to 4x per week for each of the three activities and added in some yoga. (Another 2-3 months). I also spent a good 30 minutes cooling down and stretching after each run. For my body type and interests, I think all of that stretching really helped prevent injuries.
Right now I'm at 1x per week for one activity, 1x per week for another, and running 4x per week. I want to build up to 3x per week for each of the first two things + 5x per week for running. This will take several weeks I think to get there.",
,"Finally something I can comment on in r/running. I have a primary focus of lifting with a close second of running. In my experience (420lb squat, 3:59 Marathon), increasing speed is very difficult on tired legs. Increasing distance was not hard. I'm currently reaching for a very similar goal which is a 21 min 5k and am really struggling. I try to run 3 days a week with a long run, tempo run, and track repeats being my workouts. My lifting is squat 3-4 days a week with my Olympic lifting team and bodybuilding one day a week. When I feel myself not recovering anymore, I get a lower body deep tissue massage. Body weight also becomes an interesting topic as increasing weight helps lifting and recovery but slows you down significantly. I've recently gone from 200-222 and running is much harder.
Recovery is key when it comes to multi sport. I also found that when I tapered off my lifting in prep for races (ranging from 10k to marathon), my legs felt AMAZING since they were so used to running tired from lifting. Good luck!",
,"It should all come down to what your priorities are. I train BJJ, but also lift and run. I use lifting and running for strength and conditioning for BJJ. A lot of my training time is devoted to martial arts which is 6 days a week. My gym is closed on Sunday's so I use that as my run day. I also try to lift weights in between all my training (my gym has weights). When I travel for work my focus will shift to running and lifting as it can sometimes be hard to find a gym that has BJJ classes that fit my work schedule
I was able to maintain doing all three pretty consistently but I eventually got burned out from being at the gym so much. This caused me to stop lifting for 6-9 months.
My goal for this year was to try to balance my time more effectively by having a simpler lifting regimen that would allow me to stay consistent with lifting. I also plan on scaling back on some of the martial arts classes to free up more time to lift.",
,"I run bike swim and do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Ive got a body type that packs on muscle really easy, so even though I enjoy lifting and am naturally good at it, I basically don't lift anymore. I'm 6 foot and weigh 225, so even though I'm not fat I'm really heavy so I'm not great at running, but I'm a pretty fast swimmer, and quick on a bike, as long as it's flat.
My schedule looks like this:
Monday and Wednesday Morning: Swim about 2000-3000 yards. Afternoon: run with the dog and the kid in the stroller to the dog/kid park 2.5 miles away, hang out for a half hour then jog back
Tuesday-Thursday Morning- 25 mile bike ride (road bike) or if the weather sucks I'll swim or do CrossFit type stuff Evening- BJJ
Friday- 50 mile bike ride, water polo, or long slow run 8-10 miles with the dog
Sat- Sunday Swim both days open mat on Saturday, Sundays bloody Maries and brunch with the wife after the swim. Weekends are normally pretty flexible though and if I'm tired I'll take it easy.
Also one of my Jiu-Jitsu buddies that I work with will roll for an hour at lunch once or twice a week.
Of course life and work gets in the way, so I'll miss a workout every once in a while, but I make it a point to do something physical for at least an hour a day.
I dont really have rest days, but I'm military so when I leave for training and stuff I'll be gone for a couple weeks and I recover then. Normally on trips ill just cut it back to small runs and some maintenance lifting when we're not doing physical stuff that day at work.",
https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/c3ftdm/how_do_you_incorporate_other_sports_into_your/,"I sort of do a season thing, like high school sports. I run more in the summers, and less in the winters. Summer means 4 days of running 2 of powerlifting and in winter I do four days of lifting, 2 days of running, and a couple of cycling classes a week.",
,"4 runs a week, either before work or after. 3 days of weight lifting at the gym. Either on rest days or in the morning/evening if I run that day. Doing this while training for a marathon.
It's exhausting but doable. I got sick this week so I haven't hit the gym, only my runs. Other than work and maintaining my home, I don't have any other major time sinks",
,"My cross-training is solely aimed at improving my run (~80km/wk) - mostly calisthenics and weights for core strength/hips/glutes. The goal has been to stay injury-free and go faster, not to get good at another sport/activity, so keep it light: 30 mins or so every other day. Usually late afternoon/evening after a morning run, and do it all at home.",
,"I tried really hard to run, climb, and lift. I would run 3x a week in the morning, somewhere between 4 miles and a 10k and then I would do something like 8-10 miles on Sunday. I would climb two days a week in the morning and then on Saturday morning through the early afternoon, and I would lift after work 4x a week. This, combined with my relatively intensive job, absolutely fucking killed me. I have since injured my knee and stopped running and now I only climb and lift and it’s a bit more sustainable but I really do miss running. I also noticed that running and lifting kind of pulled in opposite directions of one another rather than compliment. It’s hard to bulk while running 30 miles a week.
I would say that climbing is my favorite activity by far and that I mostly weight lift to improve my climbing ability and to maintain a figure that I like. I really enjoy running but I have bad knees and running just exacerbates all of knee issues like you wouldn’t believe. I’m also very much into wilderness backpacking and I’m starting to get into thru-hiking (PCT next year?) so I really need my knees to hold up. People have recommended cycling as a less impactful alternative to running but I’ve honestly just never cared for cycling.",
,"Climb three times a week, strength twice a week, running three to four times a week. Thats me anyway. I mostly trail run.",
,"Morning: Run 4x/week, average 25-30 miles. Evening: Climb 2x/week indoors, weekends outdoors. That's just about all I do, really, with yoga interspersed whenever there's time after workouts. Running fulfills the endurance/aerobic while climbing is power/endurance/some anaerobic.",
,"Lift/climb on your easy run days or rest days.
It really depends on what ""a sustainable way"" means to you. Are you training to PR on a half/full marathon? Then cross training time available is going to be somewhat limited. If you are ""just"" training to complete races for fun without a specific time in mind then climb when you want, run when you want, just try to keep a ""minimum"" mileage so you don't feel like you're starting from zero every other month.
Used to climb 2-3 days a week while running 4-5 days week. After I injured my rotator cuff I cancelled my membership while I healed up and didn't go back out of laziness. Instead I replaced climbing with lifting. For the first time in about 7 years I don't have a ""target race"" to train for, so I'm just running/cycling to keep fit, if the lifting bug bites, I'll run 2-3 days all week and hit the gym 4 days a week instead",
,"I've got an ideal week that I try to stick to, but give it no real mind if I miss up to 3 events.
Sunday I have a long run, so monday no running, but lift in the afternoon. Tuesday I run before work, and go boxing in the afternoon. Wednesday I skip a run because boxing is late, so I just lift in the afternoon. Thursday I run in the morning and lift in the afternoon. Friday I try to lift in the afternoon. Saturday I go for a medium to long run or just do something outside. For me this is super sustainable, but I don't have a ton of commitments as a single 20 something",
,"Wow this is my exact problem rn...trying to fit in running and climbing and lifting weights!! The best plan i could come up for doing all 3 without overlapping activities was 3 runs/week (1 of which was a long run), 1 leg day for weights, and then climbing 2 days. I know that’s kind of on the low side for more serious runners but running is my least favorite of the three. I also felt like i couldn’t run the day (or even 2 days) after leg day lol. I wanted to have an arms lift day but mostly didn’t get around to it and figured climbing could be my substitute - it’s hard to fit everything in.",
,"Recently though I’ve just gone with whatever my body feels. If I feel like climbing more that week then I’ll just do more of that and I’ve been running less. I sometimes get caught up in meeting different fitness goals but it’s been good to just step back a bit, have fun, and remember I’ll meet my goals along the way!",
https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/tppt4w/incorporating_tracking_crosstraining/,"“For general physiological benefits time spent at intensity (usually measured with heart rate and divided in zones) is the obvious choice. If I spend three hours in zone 1 on a horse that's probably going to give a similar physiological adaptation as spending that time on your feet but it won't come with any of the specific tissue adaptation and technical improvements that are specific to running.
When I do a ski tour and spend 4hrs in zone 1-2 I count it to my total training time. When I go for a hike and barely get into zone 1 I don't.”",
,"You will have to do some trial and error and see if you can push the long runs. I will tell you that your training will be sub par if you can't put in the minimum mileage. So being able to do the long run doesn't better enable you to run the marathon if you are cutting weekly mileage.
If you are running 40-50 miles a week with a 16 mile long run that's way better than running 30-40 miles a week with a 20 mile long run. So just keep that in mind.
It's better to get out there and run every day and get something in than just to place too much importance on your long run.
But you will have to experiment and figure out what your body can tolerate.
I am a lifter and an ultra runner. Right now I have backed my lifting off to 2 days a week (full body sessions) instead of my normal upper lower split. When I run my VO2 Max and Tempo cycles I do lower overall volume and can lift more. As my ultra running season comes in I will drop my lifting days and do lower intensity, to be able to do more running volume.
During my lifting season I'm running under 30 miles a week to put everything in my lifting training.
Do I lose some strength and maybe some mass in my ultra training cycles? Yes. But do I start off at zero? hell no. I start off at 85-90% of where I left off.
I personally have found I can rebuild bases very quickly as long as I'm using common sense and my brain. I can add 20-30% per week as long as I add, hold, add, hold. Do a deload if I feel I need to (cut a week of volume to recover).
I went from knee surgery with 4 months off to ultra marathon in 4 months (peaking at 80 miles a week). Now granted I was 50 miles a week consistently till the day before surgery.
Like I said you have to figure out where your personal tolerance is and what works for you.
My point of picking a sport is you will have to back off riding if riding is interfering with your marathon training, if the goal is a marathon PR.
Cross training takes away from training, it doesn't add to it. It interferes with recovery so its a negative not a positive. Which is fine, when you love two sports you just have to figure out how to balance both.",
,"Scientifically cross training doesn't add a cross sport benefit until you do cross training enough to see a benefit.
So for example cycling while running. You have to cycle enough to get performance benefits at cycling, before you will see the benefits of cycling cross over to running. And in that situation, cycling would take so much time and effort where that time and effort would have been better placed in running more. Again because cycling to that level is going to take away from running and much as it's not time spent running.
So logically it seems to make sense that cross training helps, but scientifically it doesn't. Riding doesn't work the same muscle in the same way as running, so no it doesn't help running and it impacts recovery from your runs so you benefit less from some of those running workouts.
My recommendation would be to try to run at least 5 days a week and do all easy aerobic runs. It will give you less of an interference effect.
I used to ride (many moons ago) but outside of physically having enough time I don't see why you can't do both. The issue will be initially just getting that volume up slowly and steadily so that your body can handle it all, but I think you can do it.",
https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1859ph1/balancing_running_with_other_high_intensity_sports/,"I think a lot of it comes down to how you feel after your other sports. I play 7v7 soccer (60' games) once a week in the evenings. I've found that I generally feel a bit beat up after games, so I generally stack a running workout on the same day so that I can recover the day after. I play in the evenings, so I'll normally run a slightly reduced workout earlier in the day (cut back by 15% or so). I find that if I do a full workout before soccer, my legs feel a bit heavier than I'd like during the game. If soccer is early enough in the evening, I'll do my running workout immediately after games. If I do that, I can do a full workout and feel totally fine.",
,"It depends on how hard you want to train really and what your time management is like. For instance, if I were to do an 8mi hike or ski for 5 hours, I still go out and do at least 8 miles of running that day. In my mind, running miles are running miles and while that stuff counts as some ""extra"" benefit, it doesn't replace running. You might prefer to replace a day of running with soccer, and in that case I would just choose to replace an easier day",
,"I play competitive soccer on top of running. I have soccer practice 2 times a week and 1-2 games each weekend from March to November except for a little summer brake. I have a speed session with a track and field club once a week, do one long run and fill the other days with easy/recovery runs or biking. I usually strength train on the days I have soccer practice.",
,"I've ran 3 marathons (so all of them) while training and playing football (soccer), 2 of them with a good training plan: Pfitz 55. But I do play as a goalkeeper so in a match I don't really accumulate that much mileage. During winters I play futsal (i.e. indoor football), also as a GK. Futsal goalkeeping is very intensive as you see alot of action, especially if you join the attacks and have to run back-and-forth all the time. During winters it means training once a week and a game every other weekend or so. For football, I used to do trainings twice a week with a game most of the weeks, nowadays it's a game most of the weeks and trainings on Sunday evenings sometimes. I can also do stuff like play tennis/padel during the week, the limiting factory is usually only time available.
I basically run the program normally and just add on football on the side. My recommendation would be that if it's just once a week, you have to judge what your current fitness level is and if you also can just add on football to your training program. If you have lots of running history, this should be fine but if it's your first Marathon-/Pfitz-program, perhaps try to proceed cautiously.
I find that if I have a long run on Sunday morning, my knees are really beat up in the evening and running on the practice field is not enjoyable, but I always try to run my long runs on Saturday because I want to have a good nights sleep before long runs, so leave any alcohol consumption for Saturday post long run",
,"My main sport is motorcycle racing (on road circuit) so vastly different to marathon or triathlon which I also train for. My take is that you have to be realistic with you expectations. I have no will to go for a sub 3 marathon and that’s fine, I’’m just happy this brings me happy moments in the winter and improves my riding skills by not being tired after 2 laps.
Bottom line. Set your goals, train around it and enjoy. If your goal is hiking crazy mountains, enjoy. You may be very average in marathon but still it will help you. Don’t over think it",
https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/n11sli/mixing_recreational_sports_into_marathon_training/,"Can you explain me what Pfitz is and those numbers? Never heard about it. And yes, my running training regimen is normally very demanding, especially during the most specific phases within a season preparing for a HM so that I'm normally feeling miserable, drained, and unable to do many more activities. I like swimming and going to the gym and both I have to practice very moderately in order to not hinder my progress in running, which is my main goal.I played D1 tennis in college and play at a pretty high level now (mostly with recent and current college players.)
As my running has gotten more serious and taken up more time, I've had to scale back time and intensity on court. Depending on your age and natural recovery (how does your body bounce back?), you will probably have to do the same.
I had one marathon training block a couple years ago where I tried to do both. I was running or hitting every day...sometimes tennis and running on the same day. It got to the point where I couldn't do either well. I'd be cruising through a match and completely run out of steam....heavy feat, unforced errors for no reason, mental fog, etc. The combination of over-training, lack of rest / recovery days led to poor performance. More importantly I wasn't enjoying either very much.
I've concluded that if I'm going to train seriously for running, I need to cut back on tennis (during the peak training) I've worked out a system where I will play tennis on a rest day (but only doubles, which requires less court coverage and leaves me less beat up.) I'll substitute 45 minutes to an hour of easy hitting for an equivalent number of recovery miles, but maybe only once a week. I won't sacrifice any mid-long, long runs, or workouts....only recovery miles.
And if I feel like I'm overdoing it, I'll bail on the tennis.
In the end, it's just a question of what you want to prioritize",
,Those are the two sports I literally would say to shy away from. Lots of running and then fast bursts of sideways movement do not mix well in my opinion. I disagree with other posters... if you want to run well in the marathon you are doing yourself a serious disservice mixing in soccer and basketball. Not only will you really muck up recovery and train worse but you will drastically increase the likelihood of injury.,
,"I think its important to bear in mind that the costs these sports inflict on training might not offset the quality of life/happiness benefits that OP derives from playing them.
Most of us aren't professional athletes, so its chill to train for a marathon while having a bit of fun on the side",
,"Read the book “run less run faster”. It shows how to have only 3 run workouts per week while still improving marathon times. On the other days you cross train and could play sports. They’ve experimented a lot with this schedule so using it as a framework might be helpful to you.
The ""run less run faster"" approach is not going to give completely optimal results specifically for running. But for many it provides a much better holistic approach when taking into account additional interests and lifestyles. For many people like OP it can provide a solid training foundation while allowing them to continue with other sports.",
,"Major takeaway for me is to be in touch with my body and if I’m feeling rundown, take a rest day",
,"I ended up just pausing all my other sport, just for fatigue and leg management. also because I didn't want to accidentally hurt myself and then have to cancel my marathon. Im just a casual runner though. so nothing crazy, but running 70-80km per week was a lot of running! (also I'm 35, not like i'm 18 and can play social sport 7 days a week and not feel it. haha)",
,"I tried mixing soccer and marathon training in 2019. I ran a progression 18 miler on Saturday (also PFITZ). We had a soccer tournament scheduled on Sunday. I was playing goalie and my legs felt like concrete. Shots were getting past me and I felt like I couldn't move or do much about it. From that point, I decided that focusing on my training was more important and stopped playing soccer. You can definitely do both, you'd just need to time the workouts better than I did",
