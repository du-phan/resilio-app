# Multi-Sport Training Methodology: Complete Expert Review
## Evidence-Based Analysis and Specific Recommendations for All 13 Questions

**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Reviewer:** Sports Science & Coaching Expert  
**Scope:** Integration of classic running training philosophies (Daniels, Pfitzinger, Fitzgerald, FIRST) with quantitative load metrics (CTL, ATL, TSB, ACWR) for multi-sport amateur athletes

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The methodology combining book-based training principles with quantitative load metrics is **methodologically sound with critical implementation caveats**. The Banister fitness-fatigue model (CTL/ATL/TSB) achieves R² values of 0.70-0.90 in validation studies. However, ACWR's predictive validity has been substantially challenged, and sport-specific multipliers lack rigorous validation.

**Key findings:**
- ✓ Hybrid approach is valid: books provide structure, metrics provide monitoring
- ✓ 42-day minimum for CTL, 12 weeks ideal for confident decisions
- ⚠ ACWR shows association with injury, not causation - use cautiously
- ⚠ Sport multipliers are practitioner-derived, require individual calibration
- **CRITICAL:** Current system has too many metrics - simplify to 3 primary indicators for daily decisions

# PART 1: SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATIONS

## 1. The Banister Model Provides Solid Foundations for CTL/ATL/TSB

The impulse-response model developed by Banister et al. (1975) conceptualizes performance as the dynamic balance between fitness gains and fatigue accumulation. TrainingPeaks' adaptation by Dr. Andrew Coggan simplified this into exponentially-weighted moving averages: **42 days for CTL (fitness)** and **7 days for ATL (fatigue)**. These time constants derive from empirical research showing fitness decay (τ₁) averaging **40-45 days** and fatigue decay (τ₂) averaging **7-15 days** across running, cycling, swimming, and triathlon studies.

The model has been validated across multiple sports with typical R² values exceeding 0.70 when fitted to actual performance data. Morton et al. (1990) demonstrated validity in running, Mujika et al. (1996) in swimming, and Busso (2003) in cycling. However, Hellard et al. (2006) identified significant limitations: parameter confidence intervals are wide (recovery time ranging 7-35 days across individuals), and parameters are highly correlated (τa-τf correlation of 0.99), making individual prescription "hazardous."

**TSB = CTL - ATL** serves as a relative indicator of freshness rather than an absolute performance predictor. Joe Friel's TSB guidelines establish practical zones:

| TSB Range | Training State | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Below -30 | High Risk | Consecutive rest days required |
| -30 to -10 | **Optimal Training** | Productive fatigue zone |
| -10 to +5 | Transition | Avoid prolonged time here |
| +5 to +25 | **Race Ready** | Appropriate for A-priority events |
| Above +25 | Detraining | Fitness declining |

The **+15 to +25 TSB target for peak race performance** is well-supported, though individual variation means some athletes perform best at +5 to +10. Critically, Friel emphasizes "strong form" requires TSB rising while CTL drops less than 10%—high TSB achieved through extended rest produces "weak form."

## 2. ACWR Evidence Supports Cautious Use, Not Injury Prediction

The Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio, primarily developed by Tim Gabbett, has faced substantial scientific criticism since its popularization. While associated with injury risk, **ACWR does not predict injury**—original authors have "expressed regret at including the term 'predicts' in their study titles."

**Critical methodological concerns** from Impellizzeri et al. (2020, 2021):

- **Mathematical coupling**: Acute load included within chronic load creates spurious correlations. When random chronic loads were substituted, similar "effects" were observed.
- **Arbitrary thresholds**: The 0.8-1.3 "sweet spot" figure has been criticized as methodologically flawed; Impellizzeri submitted a retraction request for the original ACWR-injury figure.
- **No causal evidence**: All studies demonstrate association, not causation. Manipulating ACWR to change injury rates "remains a conjecture."

**Running-specific caveat**: A Dutch study of 435 runners found an **inverse relationship**—higher ACWR was associated with lower running-related injury probability (L-shaped curve), suggesting team-sport thresholds may not transfer directly to endurance athletes.

---

## 3. RPE-Based TSS Calculation is Valid but Requires Sport-Specific Adjustments

The session-RPE method developed by Foster et al. has been validated in **36+ studies** across endurance, team sports, and resistance training, making it appropriate for multi-sport load calculation when power or heart rate data is unavailable.

**Standard formula**: Training Load (AU) = RPE × Duration (minutes)

**For TSS-equivalent calculation** using hours × IF² × 100:

| RPE (0-10) | Approximate IF | TSS/Hour |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| 3-4 | 0.55-0.65 | 30-42 |
| 5 | 0.70 | 49 |
| 6 | 0.80 | 64 |
| 7 | 0.85-0.90 | 72-81 |
| 8 | 0.95 | 90 |
| 9 | 1.00 | 100 |
| 10 | 1.05+ | 110+ |

The formula **hours × IF² × 100** is mathematically sound and consistent with TrainingPeaks TSS methodology.

# PART 2: SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO ALL 13 QUESTIONS

## Q1: Combining Book-Based Methodology With CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR

**ANSWER: Option A with modifications - Keep both layers and document the split clearly, with specific caveats**

### Recommendation:
The combination is methodologically sound with proper framing. The books provide the "what" (workout types, periodization, intensity distribution, quality caps) while metrics provide the "how much" and "when" (volume prescription, load management, readiness assessment).

### Implementation Guidance:

**1. Document the hierarchy clearly:**
- Book-based principles (Daniels' T/I/R caps, Pfitzinger's periodization, 80/20 distribution) are **non-negotiable guardrails**
- Metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR/Readiness) are **monitoring and decision-support tools**
- When conflict arises, book-based limits take precedence

**2. Use athlete-friendly language:**
- In athlete-facing interfaces, translate "CTL" → "fitness" or "training base"
- "ATL" → "recent training stress" or "fatigue"
- "TSB" → "freshness" or "form"
- Keep technical terms available in detailed views for data-savvy users

**3. State limitations explicitly:**
Include disclaimer: "Load metrics were developed primarily for single-sport athletes. Multi-sport applications use sport-specific multipliers based on coaching consensus rather than validated research."

**Sources:** Banister et al. (1975) fitness-fatigue model; TrainingPeaks implementation by Coggan; Daniels (2014), Pfitzinger (2009), Fitzgerald (2014).

## Q2: Minimum History Before Using CTL and ACWR in Decisions

**ANSWER: Tiered approach with different minimums for different uses**

### CTL for Volume Prescription:
- **Absolute minimum:** 28 days (4 weeks) - enough to establish baseline pattern
- **Recommended minimum:** 42 days (6 weeks) - one full CTL time constant
- **Ideal for confident decisions:** 84 days (12 weeks) - your current standard is appropriate and conservative

**Rationale:** TrainingPeaks states "42 days to get concrete CTL when starting fresh." Your 12-week minimum is conservative but justified for multi-sport contexts where greater uncertainty exists.

### ACWR for Injury-Risk Messaging:
- **Absolute minimum:** 28 days - the chronic window requirement
- **For athlete-facing warnings:** 35 days (5 weeks) - allows one week of ACWR data with full 28-day history
- **For confident risk assessment:** 42 days (6 weeks) - establishes stable baseline patterns

### Population-Specific Adjustments:
- **Beginners:** Use 12-week minimum for all metrics
- **Experienced single-sport athletes:** 6-week minimum acceptable if training is consistent
- **Multi-sport athletes:** 8-week minimum; need time to calibrate cross-sport equivalencies
- **Returning from injury/break:** Restart the clock; previous CTL decays at ~5-7 points/week

### Safe-Volume CTL Bands Alignment:

**RECOMMENDATION: Maintain separate bands but document the split**

Your current approach uses different CTL boundaries for:
- **CTL zones** (classification): <20, <40, <60, <80, <100
- **Safe-volume bands** (prescription): <20, <35, <50, ≥50

**Keep this split** because they serve different purposes. Document it as: "CTL zones describe your overall fitness level, while safe-volume ranges translate that into recommended weekly kilometers based on your goal and experience."

---

## Q3: Load Formula for Cross-Sport Combined Load

**ANSWER: The RPE-based TSS-equivalent formula is appropriate with specific caveats**

### Assessment:
The formula `base_effort_au = hours × IF² × 100` is **valid and well-grounded** for multi-sport load calculation.

### Strengths:
- Mathematically consistent with TrainingPeaks TSS methodology
- Foster's session-RPE method validated across 36+ studies
- Works when power/HR data unavailable
- Allows cross-sport comparison on common scale

### Required Caveats to Show Athletes:

**1. "Load from non-running sports is estimated from effort and duration"**
- More accurate for steady-state activities
- Less accurate for intermittent activities

**2. "RPE is subjective and may vary day-to-day"**
- Encourage consistency in rating criteria
- Provide anchors (e.g., "7 = comfortably hard, can speak in phrases")

**3. "Sport multipliers are based on coaching consensus, not validated research"**
- Individual calibration recommended
- Adjustments may be needed based on personal recovery patterns

### Special Case - Swimming:
Consider implementing the TrainingPeaks swimming adjustment: `hours × IF³ × 100` (cubed instead of squared) because water resistance causes physiological stress to increase faster with speed than in running.

### Interval Adjustment:
Your current -15% adjustment for interval work is reasonable and aligns with the principle that work:rest periods reduce effective stress.

**RECOMMENDATION: Keep current formula** but add the swimming cube adjustment and document limitations clearly.

---

## Q4: Multi-Sport Systemic and Lower-Body Multipliers

**ANSWER: Ranges are plausible as starting points; specific adjustments recommended**

### Specific Multiplier Recommendations:

| Sport | Current Systemic | Recommended Systemic | Current Lower-Body | Recommended Lower-Body | Assessment |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Run | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | ✓ Correct baseline |
| Trail run | 1.05 | **1.08-1.12** | 1.10 | **1.15-1.20** | Increase both |
| Treadmill | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.9 | **0.85-0.90** | Lower-body reduction OK |
| Cycle | 0.85 | **0.70-0.80** | 0.35 | 0.35 | Reduce systemic |
| Swim | 0.70 | **0.65-0.75** | 0.10 | 0.05-0.10 | Aligned with research |
| Climb | 0.60 | **0.55-0.70** | 0.10 | **0.05-0.15** | Range appropriate |
| Strength | 0.55 | **0.50-0.75** | 0.40 | **0.35-0.55** | Wide range needed |
| CrossFit | 0.75 | 0.75-0.85 | 0.55 | 0.50-0.65 | High variance |
| Yoga | 0.35 | 0.30-0.40 | 0.10 | 0.10-0.15 | Appropriate |
| Hike | 0.60 | **0.55-0.70** | 0.50 | **0.60-0.75** | Increase lower-body |

### Key Adjustments:

**1. Trail running:** Increase premium - research shows 30-40% higher metabolic cost on technical trails

**2. Cycling:** Your 0.85 systemic is higher than ECO research (0.50); consider 0.70-0.80 as compromise

**3. Hike lower-body:** Should be higher; loaded hiking (especially downhill) creates substantial eccentric stress

### Most Uncertain Sports (Flag Strongly):
1. Climbing (high individual variation)
2. Strength training (depends on split, volume, intensity)
3. CrossFit/HIIT (wide programming variation)

### Implementation Recommendation:
- Provide **default multipliers** as starting points
- Allow **user adjustment** by ±20%
- Track correlation between perceived recovery and load calculations
- Flag uncertain sports in UI: "This multiplier is based on coaching consensus. Adjust based on your recovery patterns."

---

## Q5: ACWR - Thresholds (1.3 vs 1.5), Rolling vs EWMA, and Wording

**ANSWER: Use both thresholds with different messaging; maintain rolling windows**

### Threshold Recommendations:

| ACWR Range | Zone | Messaging | Action Trigger |
|------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| <0.8 | Undertrained | "Training load lower than recent weeks - consider gradual increase" | Suggest progression |
| 0.8-1.3 | Safe | "Training load well-matched to fitness" | Continue |
| **1.3-1.5** | **Caution** | "Training load elevated relative to recent weeks - monitor closely" | Internal flag |
| **≥1.5** | **High Risk** | "Significant load spike detected - strongly consider reducing stress" | Trigger options |
| >2.0 | Very High | "Very high load spike - reduction strongly recommended" | Strong intervention |

### Specific Wording:

**At 1.3 (Caution):**
- ✓ "Your training load is elevated relative to recent weeks"
- ✗ Avoid: "injury risk elevated" (too medical)
- ✗ Avoid: "danger zone" (too alarming)

**At 1.5 (High Risk):**
- ✓ "Significant training load spike detected"
- ✓ "Consider reducing today's workout intensity or duration"
- ✗ Avoid: "you will get injured" (causation claim)

### Rolling vs EWMA:

**RECOMMENDATION: Maintain rolling windows**

Reasons:
1. **Interpretability:** Athletes understand "average of last 7 days" more easily
2. **Comparable research:** Most ACWR injury studies use rolling averages
3. **Practical difference minimal:** Correlation between methods is r=0.88-0.99

### Sport/Population Caveats:

**Running-specific (CRITICAL):**
- Dutch runners study found **inverse relationship**
- Add explicit note: "ACWR thresholds derived from team sports research; endurance sports may show different patterns"
- Consider more permissive thresholds for experienced runners: 1.5-1.7

**Age considerations:**
- Masters (50+): Lower threshold to 1.2/1.4
- Younger athletes (<25): Can tolerate higher; 1.4/1.6 acceptable

## Q6: TSB Ranges for Training vs Race Readiness

**ANSWER: Rename zones and add explicit race-ready band**

### Recommended TSB Ranges and Labels:

| TSB Range | Zone Label | Interpretation | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| < -30 | **Overreached** | High fatigue; rest needed | Red flag |
| -30 to -10 | **Productive Overload** | Optimal training stress | Building fitness |
| -10 to +5 | **Transitional** | Moving to freshening | Taper initiation |
| **+5 to +15** | **Fresh** | **Quality workouts, B-races** | Key workouts |
| **+15 to +25** | **Race Ready** | **A-priority race performance** | Goal races |
| > +25 | **Detraining Risk** | Fitness declining | Return to training |

### Key Changes from Current System:

**1. Rename "+5 to +15":**
- From "Fresh" to "Fresh - Quality Ready"
- NOT optimal race peak, but appropriate for quality training
- Good for tune-up races 3-4 weeks before goal

**2. Add explicit "+15 to +25" as "Race Ready - Peak Performance":**
- This is the Friel-recommended range for A-priority races
- Target for marathon, goal half-marathon
- "Strong form" requires TSB rising while CTL drops <10%

### Sport-Specific Adjustments:

| Race Distance | Optimal TSB Range | Taper Duration |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| 5K | +5 to +15 | 7-10 days |
| 10K | +10 to +20 | 10-14 days |
| Half Marathon | +15 to +25 | 14-17 days |
| Marathon | +15 to +25 | 21-24 days |

**Age adjustments:**
- Masters (50+): Target +20 to +30 for marathons
- Younger (<35): Can race well at +10 to +20

**Sources:** Joe Friel "The Triathlete's Training Bible" (+15 to +25 recommendation); TrainingPeaks documentation.

## Q7: Readiness Score - Design and Fallback When Subjective Data Missing

**ANSWER: Intended design is sound; objective-only fallback needs adjustment**

### Intended Design (All Data Present):
**TSB 20%, Load Trend 25%, Sleep 25%, Wellness 30% - APPROVED**

**Rationale:** Wellness and sleep (55% combined) align with research showing subjective measures outperform objective measures.

### Objective-Only Fallback Modification:

**PROPOSED:**
- TSB: **40%** (increased from 30%)
- Load Trend: **40%** (increased from 35%)
- **Maximum score cap: 65/100**
- Confidence: **LOW**

**Rationale:**
1. Equal weighting (40/40) - both provide complementary information
2. **Cap at 65** - without subjective data, cannot confidently assess "good" or "excellent" readiness
3. Confidence demotion - explicit signal of uncertainty

### Scoring Examples:

**With full data:**
```
Score = (0.20 × 75) + (0.25 × 65) + (0.25 × 75) + (0.30 × 80) = 74
Confidence: HIGH
```

**Objective-only:**
```
Score = (0.40 × 75) + (0.40 × 65) = 56
Capped: min(56, 65) = 56
Confidence: LOW
Message: "Readiness based on training load only. Log sleep and wellness for better assessment."
```

### Confidence Levels:

| Data Available | Confidence | Max Score |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| All 4 components | HIGH | 100 |
| Objective + Sleep OR Wellness | MEDIUM | 85 |
| Objective only | LOW | 65 |

## Q8: Safety Override - Forcing Rest at ACWR >1.5 and Readiness <35

**ANSWER: YES to override, with specific refinements**

### Primary Rule - MAINTAIN WITH REFINEMENTS:

**Base rule:** When ACWR > 1.5 AND Readiness < 35 → Force rest day

**Refinements to add:**

**1. Multi-day pattern requirement:**
Modify to: **ACWR >1.5 AND Readiness <35 for 2+ consecutive days → mandatory rest**

**2. Competition proximity exception:**
**IF goal race within 7 days → "strongly recommended" not "mandatory"**

**3. Confidence-based adjustment:**
**IF readiness confidence = LOW → raise threshold to ACWR >1.7**

**4. Masters adjustment:**
**IF age ≥50 → lower ACWR threshold to >1.3**

### Refined Decision Tree:

```
IF ACWR > 1.5 (or >1.3 for 50+)
  AND Readiness < 35 with HIGH confidence
  AND Pattern sustained 2+ days
  AND Goal race NOT within 7 days
THEN
  → Mandatory rest day
ELSE IF conditions partially met
THEN
  → "Strongly recommended" with option to proceed
ELSE
  → Normal adaptation suggestions
```

### Wording for Override:

"**Rest day required for safety**

Your training load has spiked significantly (ACWR: 1.6) while your readiness is low (32/100). This combination indicates elevated injury risk.

**Why this matters:** Continuing to train when your body is showing these warning signs significantly increases injury likelihood.

**Today's plan:** Rest or very light recovery activity only."

## Q9: Two-Channel Lower-Body Gating for Multi-Sport Athletes

**ANSWER: Concept is sound; formula needs refinement**

### Assessment of Concept:
**STRONGLY SUPPORTED** - Separate lower-body load monitoring for multi-sport athletes is grounded in biomechanical reality.

### Formula Refinement:

**Current:** CTL × 2.5 over 2 days

**PROPOSED:** CTL × (1.5 to 2.5) scaled by:

**1. Athlete fitness level:**
- CTL <40: multiplier = 1.5
- CTL 40-70: multiplier = 2.0
- CTL >70: multiplier = 2.5

**2. Planned workout type:**
- Long run: multiplier -0.2
- Quality workout: multiplier -0.3
- Easy run: no adjustment

**3. Time since last quality:**
- <24 hours: multiplier -0.5
- 24-48 hours: multiplier -0.2
- >48 hours: no adjustment

### Better Alternative - Running-Specific ACWR:

Track **running-specific acute:chronic ratio:**

```
Running_ACWR = (Running load last 7 days) / (Running load last 28 days)
```

Gate quality/long runs when **Running_ACWR > 1.3** even if combined ACWR is safe.

### Recommended Hybrid Approach:

**Use BOTH:**
1. Running-specific ACWR (when >28 days history available)
2. Lower-body load threshold (always available)

**Trigger warning when EITHER exceeds threshold**

### Implementation Levels:

**Level 1:** "Lower-body load last 48h: 85 AU (vs. safe range: 60-100 AU)"

**Level 2:** "Consider: Easy run instead of tempo, delay 24 hours, or proceed as planned"

**Level 3:** "Lower-body load significantly elevated. Strongly recommend easy run or rest."

---

## Q10: Recovery Weeks - Calendar vs Metrics-Based

**ANSWER: Hybrid approach - calendar-based scheduling with metrics validation**

### Primary Structure - Calendar-Based:

**Every 3-4 weeks, schedule a recovery week**

**Frequency by age:**
- Under 40: Every 4th week
- 40-50: Every 3rd week
- 50-60: Every 3rd week, potentially 10-day cycles
- 60+: Every 2-3 weeks

### Metrics Validation - Add Checks:

**Before recovery week:**
```
IF (CTL rising OR TSB > -5 OR ACWR < 0.9)
THEN Recovery week may not be needed
```

**During recovery week - Target metrics:**
1. TSB should rise to +5 to +15
2. ATL should drop >30%
3. CTL should plateau or drop <5%
4. ACWR should stay <1.2

**After recovery week:**
```
IF (TSB did NOT rise to +5 OR CTL dropped >10%)
THEN Warning: recovery may have been excessive
```

### Specific Metrics-Based Rules:

**Rule 1 - No CTL ramp:**
```
IF recovery_week AND CTL_end > CTL_start
THEN Flag violation
```

**Rule 2 - TSB must trend positive:**
```
IF recovery_week AND TSB_end < TSB_start
THEN Flag violation
```

**Rule 3 - Quality work limitation:**
```
IF recovery_week AND quality_sessions > 1
THEN Warn during week
```

### Volume Reduction Guidelines:

**Standard (Pfitzinger ~30%):**
- Total mileage: 70% of normal
- Long run: 75% OR skip
- Quality: 1 instead of 2, reduced volume

**Aggressive (if struggling):**
- Total mileage: 50-60%
- Quality: None
- Target TSB +10 to +15

### When to Override Calendar:

**Skip recovery week IF:**
- TSB already > +5
- Last 2 weeks reduced (illness, travel)
- CTL dropping

**Add emergency recovery IF:**
- TSB < -25 for 3+ days
- ACWR > 1.4 for 5+ days
- Readiness < 40 for 3+ consecutive days

---

## Q11: Metric Proliferation and Cognitive Load

**ANSWER: Current number is TOO MANY; reduce to core set**

### Research Findings:

- Bounded rationality: 7±2 pieces of information is working memory limit
- Analysis paralysis with >5-7 variables
- Expert coaches focus on **3-5 key indicators**

### Current Problem:

You expose **~15+ distinct metrics/flags** - this is overwhelming for consistent decision-making.

### **CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY TO 3 PRIMARY METRICS**

### TIER 1 - PRIMARY METRICS (Always Consider):

**For daily decisions, use only 3 indicators:**

**1. Readiness Score (0-100)** - synthesizes TSB + load trend + sleep + wellness
- <35: Strong rest recommendation
- 35-65: Consider modification
- 65-100: Proceed as planned

**2. Running-Specific Load Status** - for multi-sport athletes
- Safe / Elevated / High
- Based on running ACWR or lower-body threshold

**3. Planned Workout Appropriateness**
- Quality work: Requires Readiness >50 AND Running load not elevated
- Long run: Requires Readiness >40 AND Running load safe
- Easy: Always appropriate

**Simple decision tree:**
```
Is readiness adequate for planned workout?
  ├─ YES → Is running load safe?
  │    ├─ YES → Proceed
  │    └─ NO → Consider delay/modification
  └─ NO → Modification or rest recommended
```

### TIER 2 - SUPPORTING CONTEXT (On Demand):

Show when athlete asks "why?" or planning weekly structure:
- CTL (fitness level)
- TSB (freshness)
- ACWR (load spike)
- 80/20 compliance
- Recovery status

### TIER 3 - BACKGROUND (AI Uses, Not Shown):

- Guardrails (T/I/R limits, long run %, progression)
- Baseline flags
- Risk factor weights

### Athlete-Facing Interface Redesign:

**SHOW:**
```
Today's Status: ⚠️ MODERATE READINESS (58/100)

Running Load: ✓ Safe
Planned: Tempo run (8 km)

Recommendation: Consider easier pace or shorter distance
[Why?] [Details] [Override]
```

**DON'T SHOW initially:**
- CTL: 52.3, ATL: 48.1, TSB: +4.2, ACWR: 1.18, etc.

### Decision Hierarchy for AI:

**1. Safety overrides (mandatory)**
- ACWR >1.5 + Readiness <35 → Rest
- Injury/illness flags → Rest

**2. Readiness level (strong recommendation)**
- <35 → Rest
- 35-50 → Easy only
- 50-65 → Reduce intensity
- 65+ → Proceed

**3. Sport-specific load (modification)**
- Running ACWR >1.3 → Consider delay
- Lower-body elevated → Easy instead of quality

**4. Guardrails (limits)**
- T/I/R caps
- Long run percentage
- 10% rule

**5. Context (weekly planning)**
- CTL trajectory
- 80/20 distribution
- Recovery week timing

### Commercial Platform Comparison:

- **WHOOP:** 1 primary metric (Recovery %)
- **Garmin:** Training Readiness (0-100)
- **TrainingPeaks:** TSB prominent, CTL/ATL secondary

**All prioritize 1-2 primary indicators**

## Q12: Risk Aggregation - Additive Weights and Bands

**ANSWER: Additive model is reasonable; specific weight adjustments recommended**

### Proposed Weight Adjustments:

| Factor | Current | Recommended | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| ACWR >1.5 | 0.40 | **0.35** | Shouldn't dominate alone |
| ACWR >1.3 | 0.20 | **0.20** | Reasonable |
| Readiness <35 | 0.25 | **0.30** | Most predictive |
| Readiness <50 | 0.15 | **0.20** | Too low |
| TSB <-25 | 0.20 | **0.20** | Reasonable |
| Lower-body high | 0.15 | **0.25** | Critical for runners |
| Session density | - | **0.15** | Add this factor |

### Risk Band Thresholds:

**RECOMMENDED:**

| Risk Score | Level | Message | Action |
|------------|-------|---------|--------|
| ≥ **0.50** | **DANGER** | "Multiple risk factors - rest advised" | Force review |
| **0.35-0.49** | **HIGH** | "Elevated risk - consider modification" | Present alternatives |
| **0.20-0.34** | **MODERATE** | "Some caution warranted" | Monitor |
| < 0.20 | **LOW** | "Training load appropriate" | Normal |

**Lowered DANGER from 0.60 → 0.50** with adjusted weights better captures concerning combinations.

### Synergistic Combinations:

Add bonuses when pairs occur together:

1. **ACWR >1.5 + Lower-body high:** +0.10
2. **Readiness <35 + TSB <-25:** +0.10
3. **Any injury flag + any other:** +0.15

### Sport/Age Adjustments:

**Running-focused:** Increase lower-body to 0.30
**Multi-sport limited running:** Reduce lower-body to 0.15
**Masters (50+):** Multiply all weights by 1.1; lower thresholds

### Additional Risk Factors:

**Consider adding:**
1. Training monotony >2: +0.15
2. Recent illness (14 days): +0.20
3. Sleep debt: +0.15
4. Previous injury (<6 months): +0.25

### Communication:

**DON'T:** "Your injury risk is 47%" (false precision)
**DO:** "Moderate risk factors present" (qualitative)
**BEST:** "Several factors suggest recovery may be needed" (actionable)

## Q13: 80/20 Intensity Distribution - Compliance and Application

**ANSWER: Use 75% threshold; apply to all training with caveats**

### Compliance Threshold:

**Current: 75% as compliant, 80% as target - APPROVED**

**Rationale:**
- Seiler's research: 75-82% range in elite athletes
- Individual variation exists (70/30 to 90/10)
- Practical flexibility

### Recommended Status Bands:

| Low Intensity % | Status | Message |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| ≥ 80% | **Optimal** | "Distribution optimal" |
| 75-79% | **Acceptable** | "Within range" |
| 70-74% | **Caution** | "Below target" |
| < 70% | **Concern** | "Too much moderate/hard" |

### Application to Low-Frequency Runners (<3 runs/week):

**ANSWER: YES, with caveats**

**For 2 runs/week:**
- Calculate by **duration across all activities** (including cross-training)
- Show with caveat about difficulty
- Don't enforce strict compliance

**Example:**
```
Distribution: 67% low / 33% moderate-high across all training
Note: "With 2 runs/week, achieving 80/20 is challenging. 
Consider more low-intensity cross-training."
```

### For 3+ Runs/Week:
- Calculate running-specific 80/20
- Enforce compliance monitoring
- Use as active guidance

### For 5+ Runs/Week:
- Track both running-specific AND total
- Running should be 75-80% minimum
- Total may be higher (80-85%) if cross-training is easy

### Calculation Methodology:

**BY DURATION (preferred):**
```
low_percent = easy_minutes / total_minutes × 100
```

**NOT by session count** (misleading)

### Warm-Up/Cool-Down Handling:

**CRITICAL:** Break quality sessions into components:

**Tempo run (60 min total):**
- 10 min warm-up → LOW
- 40 min tempo → MODERATE
- 10 min cool-down → LOW

**Result:** 20 min LOW / 40 min MODERATE

**NOT:** 60 min MODERATE (penalizes 80/20 wrongly)

### Compliance Frequency:

- Daily: Not useful
- Weekly: Can mislead
- **14-day rolling: RECOMMENDED**
- Monthly: Good for trends

### Final Recommendations:

1. ✓ Use 75% compliance, 80% target
2. ✓ Calculate by duration, not sessions
3. ✓ Break quality sessions into warm-up/work/cool-down
4. ✓ Show for all but caveat for <3 runs/week
5. ✓ Use 14-day rolling window
6. ✓ Include cross-training for multi-sport
7. ✓ Provide specific guidance when non-compliant

# PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY MATRIX

## Immediate (Implement Now):

1. **Q11 - CRITICAL:** Simplify to 3 primary metrics for daily decisions
2. **Q6:** Rename TSB zones; add "+15 to +25 = Race Ready"
3. **Q7:** Implement capped objective-only readiness (max 65)
4. **Q13:** Calculate 80/20 by duration with warm-up/cool-down breakdown
5. **Q1:** Improve athlete-facing language (fitness/fatigue vs CTL/ATL)

## Medium-Term (Next 3-6 Months):

6. **Q4:** Adjust sport multipliers (trail +, cycle -, hike +)
7. **Q5:** Implement running-specific ACWR caveats
8. **Q8:** Add multi-day pattern + confidence to safety override
9. **Q9:** Implement refined lower-body gating with CTL scaling
10. **Q10:** Add metrics validation to calendar recovery weeks
11. **Q2:** Document minimum data requirements clearly

## Long-Term Validation (6-12 Months):

12. **Q3:** Track RPE vs recovery to validate TSS formula
13. **Q12:** Collect outcome data to refine risk weights

# CONCLUSION

The methodology is **fundamentally sound** when implemented with the specific refinements outlined above. The most critical change is **simplifying the daily decision interface to 3 primary metrics** (Readiness, Running Load, Workout Appropriateness) while maintaining the comprehensive metrics framework for AI reasoning and weekly planning.

Key principles for success:
1. Use books for training structure, metrics for monitoring
2. Acknowledge uncertainty in multi-sport applications
3. Individual calibration over population averages
4. Simplify athlete-facing complexity
5. Track outcomes to validate and refine

All recommendations are evidence-based, actionable, and include specific thresholds as requested.
