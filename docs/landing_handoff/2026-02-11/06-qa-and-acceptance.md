# QA and Acceptance (Core)

## Gate A: Strategy Lock
Must approve:
1. Positioning statement.
2. Claims boundaries and prohibited claims.
3. Primary conversion path.
4. Problem-first narrative quality.

## Gate B: Prototype Cleanup Lock
Must verify:
1. Lower visual density and clearer hierarchy.
2. No factual loss in setup/privacy sections.
3. Starter prompt path still works.
4. Story feels inspiring and grounded in real athlete problems.

## Gate C: Handoff Lock
Must verify:
1. External design team can proceed without unresolved product questions.
2. Research doc is useful and advisory.
3. Contract clearly separates product truth vs design ownership.

## Test Scenarios
1. First-time visitor identifies problem, value, and next action within 30 seconds.
2. Visitor can copy starter prompt and begin flow without ambiguity.
3. Setup-anxious visitor can quickly find support limits and sync caveat.
4. Privacy-conscious visitor can find data boundary in one section.
5. External design team can produce visual directions without changing product truth.
6. External engineers can implement without hidden assumptions.
7. Visitor clearly understands this is for hybrid sport mixes, not triathlon-plan positioning.
8. Visitor understands adaptation includes non-running load without implying every cross-training session directly replaces a key run.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core handoff package remains a lean set (6 core docs plus `INDEX.md`).
2. Research doc includes benchmark patterns, design-system synthesis, anti-patterns, and source links.
3. Prototype HTML is visually lighter and less redundant while preserving required IDs and behaviors.
4. Contract explicitly delegates design authority while fixing product truth constraints.
5. No unsupported claims in core docs or prototype.
