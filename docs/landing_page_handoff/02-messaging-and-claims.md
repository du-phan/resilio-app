# Messaging and Claims (Core)

## Positioning

Resilio helps athletes improve running without shrinking the rest of their training life.
It is explicitly positioned for hybrid multi-sport life (running plus other sports), not triathlon-plan positioning.

## Message Hierarchy

1. Recognition: visitors should immediately see their own training pain in the copy.
2. Problem: rigid one-sport plans fail when life and other sports change the week.
3. Promise: adaptive coaching that keeps progress moving without fake perfection.
4. Mechanism: AI coach + quantitative CLI toolkit + explainable tradeoffs.
5. Trust: setup limits and data boundaries are explicit.
6. Action: start now with a copyable guided prompt.

## Recognition Triggers (Must Appear Above Fold or Immediately After Hero)

1. "I trained hard in other sports but my running app still marks me off-plan."
2. "One missed run makes the whole week feel broken."
3. "I want running progress without dropping the sports I care about."
4. "I am not training for triathlon; I need running to coexist with my real sport mix."
5. "I wish my running app could plan around my other workouts."

## Moat Statement (Must Preserve)

Many mainstream training products are built as run-only or triathlon-centric planning experiences.
Resilio is built for hybrid training reality:
running plus sports such as bouldering, pilates, HIIT, surfing, cycling, and strength, with adaptation based on total load.

## Claim Style Guardrails

1. Prefer "many" over "most" when describing the market unless you can cite a specific source.
2. Prefer describing the user-observed failure mode ("plans ignore other workouts") over absolute capability claims about competitors.

## Story Spine

1. You are not failing the plan; the plan is failing your reality.
2. Your running should adapt to your full load, not ignore it.
3. The coach reasons with data and context, then explains why.
4. You can start immediately in conversation.

## Promise Boundaries (Must Preserve)

1. Adaptation is context-aware, not magic replacement logic.
2. Non-running sessions influence fatigue/readiness and scheduling decisions.
3. Running-specific progression still requires protected run-specific stimulus.
4. The product helps manage tradeoffs explicitly rather than pretending tradeoffs do not exist.

## CTA Contract

### Primary CTA

2. Multi-sport-aware adaptation.

## Prohibited Claims

2. Windows/WSL setup support in current workflow.
3. Zero-friction setup for all athletes regardless of sync volume.
4. Integrations beyond documented product behavior.
5. Fake social proof or fabricated customer results.
6. Messaging that frames the product as primarily a triathlon planner.

## Trust Language Requirements

1. Explicit support matrix must be visible.
2. Rate-limit caveat must be framed as expected behavior.
3. Privacy section must state local-first plus Strava boundary.

## Tone Rules

1. Plain language, low jargon.
2. Inspiring but grounded.
