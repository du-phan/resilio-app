0. Core philosophy

The 80/20 running philosophy is built on a simple yet counterintuitive premise: to run faster, the vast majority of your training must be done slower. This method challenges the common impulse to make every run "count" by pushing the pace, an instinct that often leads to stagnation and burnout. Instead, it advocates for a polarized approach where training intensity is carefully managed. This document distills the core principles of 80/20 running into a set of actionable rules and structures, designed to serve as a foundational reference for an AI-powered running coach.

The fundamental tenets of the 80/20 methodology can be framed as the following core coaching principles:

- The Foundational Rule: Approximately 80% of total weekly training time should be performed at a low intensity, with the remaining 20% dedicated to moderate and high intensities.
- The Rationale for Slow: Low-intensity running is highly repeatable, which enables the high training volume necessary to build a deep aerobic base. This volume is also the primary stimulus for the neurological self-optimization that improves running skill and for developing the mental fatigue resistance defined as "brain fitness."
- The Most Common Training Mistake: The single biggest error runners make is getting caught in a "moderate-intensity rut." This occurs when "easy" runs are performed too fast, generating too much fatigue to benefit from high-intensity workouts and not being slow enough to maximize aerobic development.
- An Evolved Best Practice: The 80/20 method is not a novel invention but rather a codification of training patterns that evolved naturally over decades among elite athletes in all endurance sports. Scientific analysis, pioneered by exercise physiologist Stephen Seiler, confirmed this intensity distribution as a hallmark of optimal training.
- Fitness Beyond Physiology: The benefits of 80/20 training extend beyond the cardiovascular system. The high volume of low-intensity running builds "brain fitness" by increasing the mind's tolerance for suffering, a key limiter in endurance performance.
- Skill Through Self-Optimization: This neurological efficiency develops not from conscious drills, but as an emergent property of the brain self-optimizing movement over thousands of repetitions. The high volume enabled by the 80% low-intensity rule provides the necessary practice ground for this process to occur.

1. Runner profile inputs (data the AI coach should collect)

Strategically collecting key data points from each runner is the first step in applying the 80/20 methodology effectively. These inputs are not arbitrary; they are the essential variables needed to select the appropriate training plan, calculate personalized intensity zones, and make safe, progressive coaching recommendations. Without this foundational data, any training prescription would be generic and potentially counterproductive.

The AI coach must collect the following data points, categorized by their operational importance:

- Required:
  - Goal Race Distance: (e.g., 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, Marathon). This is the primary determinant for selecting the correct training plan structure and the types of workouts that will be emphasized.
  - Recent Race Performance: (e.g., a 5K or 10K time from the last 2-3 months). This provides the objective, real-world data needed to accurately calculate personalized training zones for pace-based workouts.
- Optional:
  - Running Experience Level: (e.g., Beginner, Experienced). This helps in selecting the appropriate plan level (e.g., Level 1 vs. Level 3), ensuring the training load matches the runner's background.
  - Current Weekly Training Volume/Frequency: (e.g., hours or miles per week, number of runs). This is used to verify that a runner meets the prerequisite fitness level for a given plan, preventing them from jumping into a training load their body is not prepared for.
  - Access to Heart Rate Monitor: (Yes/No). Determines if heart-rate-based intensity zones can be used, which is a primary method for enforcing low-intensity discipline.
  - Access to Hills / Treadmill: (Yes/No). Informs the coach whether specific workouts like Hill Repetitions or cross-training options like uphill treadmill walking are feasible.
- Red flags / safety triggers:
  - Recent or Recurring Injuries: A history of injuries, particularly those related to high mileage, flags the runner as a strong candidate for the "aggressive" cross-training approach to build volume while mitigating impact stress.
  - Reports of Stagnation or Burnout: Feelings of being "stuck" in performance or "lousy" on most runs are classic symptoms of the moderate-intensity rut. This indicates an urgent need to enforce strict low-intensity discipline.
  - Returning from a Significant Break: This requires a conservative approach, likely beginning with a lower-volume, unstructured base-building phase before commencing a formal training plan to ensure a safe return to fitness.

2. Canonical vocabulary + ontology

Low-Intensity Run

- Plain Definition: Running at a pace below the ventilatory threshold, where breathing is easy and comfortable enough to hold a conversation. Corresponds to Zones 1-2 of a five-zone system.
- Purpose: Builds the aerobic base, develops fatigue resistance (both physiological and brain-based), and improves running skill (economy) with minimal physiological stress. This is the foundation of the 80/20 system.
- Typical Use: The majority of training volume, including Foundation Runs, Recovery Runs, and Long Runs.
- Hard Constraints: Must constitute approximately 80% of total weekly training time.
- Common Mistakes: Running too fast and creeping into moderate intensity. This is the single most common and destructive training error that the 80/20 system is designed to correct.

Moderate-Intensity Run

- Plain Definition: Running at a pace between the ventilatory threshold and the lactate threshold. Feels "somewhat hard" or "comfortably hard." Corresponds to Zone 3.
- Purpose: Develops the ability to sustain a challenging pace for a prolonged period, which is crucial for race performance in longer events like the half marathon and marathon.
- Typical Use: Tempo Runs, Cruise Intervals, and Fast Finish Runs.
- Hard Constraints: Should be used sparingly as part of the 20% of quality training. Overuse leads directly to the "moderate-intensity rut," hindering progress.
- Common Mistakes: Allowing this to become the default pace for "easy" or daily runs.

High-Intensity Run

- Plain Definition: Running at a pace above the lactate threshold. Efforts feel hard and cannot be sustained for long periods. Corresponds to Zones 4-5.
- Purpose: Boosts maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max), top-end speed, and overall cardiovascular power.
- Typical Use: All forms of interval training (Short, Long, Mixed) and Hill Repetitions.
- Hard Constraints: Limited to a small portion of the 20% of quality training. No more than two high-intensity sessions per week is a safe and effective upper limit.
- Common Mistakes: Performing too many high-intensity sessions per week. This provides diminished returns and quickly leads to overtraining, fatigue, and injury.

Lactate Threshold (LT)

- Plain Definition: The exercise intensity at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood faster than it can be cleared. It marks the boundary between moderate and high intensity.
- Purpose: Serves as a key physiological anchor point for establishing personalized training zones.
- Typical Use: Used to determine Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) or pace, from which all other intensity zones are calculated.
- Hard Constraints: LT must be determined via a field test. The primary recommended method is a 30-minute time trial (runner's LTHR is the average HR over the final 10 minutes). Alternative methods include a perceived effort test (the intensity corresponding to RPE 6/10) or a talk test (the fastest pace where speech is still comfortable but not effortless).
- Common Mistakes: Misinterpreting the required effort level for a field test (e.g., going too easy or treating it as an all-out race), which leads to inaccurate zone calculations.

Cross-Training

- Plain Definition: Non-impact or low-impact aerobic exercise used to supplement running training.
- Purpose: To increase total training volume and aerobic fitness without adding the high-impact stress and associated injury risk of more running.
- Typical Use: Activities like cycling, pool running, elliptical training, or slideboarding. It can replace scheduled easy/recovery runs or be added as extra sessions.
- Hard Constraints: A minimum of three runs per week should be maintained to ensure sufficient running-specific adaptation and skill development.
- Common Mistakes: Mistaking cross-training as a 1:1 replacement for running. While it builds aerobic fitness, it does not fully replicate the neuromuscular or biomechanical stresses required for peak running performance.

3. Decision rules (IF/THEN)

- Pace/Intensity Selection Logic:
  - IF a valid recent race time is provided, THEN calculate personalized pace zones for all workout types (e.g., Easy, Tempo, Interval), modeling the logic of a tool like the McMillan Running Calculator.
  - IF Heart Rate is the chosen intensity metric, THEN first guide the runner through a Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) field test to establish accurate, individualized training zones.
  - IF a workout involves short intervals (less than 2 minutes), THEN advise the runner to use Perceived Effort (RPE) as the primary guide, as Heart Rate will lag and not provide an accurate real-time measure of intensity.
  - IF a workout is performed on hilly terrain, THEN advise the runner to use RPE or Heart Rate to guide their effort, as pace is not a reliable measure of physiological intensity when running up or down gradients.
- Workout Substitution & Scaling:
  - IF a runner reports excessive soreness, unusual fatigue, or minor (non-acute) pain before a run, THEN recommend substituting the planned run with a cross-training session of similar duration and intended intensity.
  - IF runner reports mild, non-debilitating fatigue (e.g., poor sleep, life stress) BUT NOT pain or excessive soreness, THEN recommend proceeding with the scheduled workout but advise staying at the lower end of the prescribed pace/HR/RPE zone.
  - IF a runner is returning from a training break of more than 2 weeks, THEN recommend reducing the planned volume by at least 50% for the first week and building back gradually, ignoring the formal plan until a consistent base is re-established.
  - IF a runner is identified as highly injury-prone, THEN recommend adopting the "aggressive" cross-training approach, which involves substituting 2-3 planned weekly runs with non-impact cardio sessions.
- Plan Advancement Logic:
  - IF a runner completes a designated training phase (e.g., Base Phase), THEN automatically advance them to the next phase (e.g., Peak Phase) as prescribed in the plan's structure. Do not skip or reorder phases.
  - IF a runner completes a goal race, THEN trigger a mandatory recovery protocol. Week 1: No structured runs, only light activity IF desired. Week 2: 3-4 short, low-intensity runs only. THEN re-evaluate readiness for a new plan.

4. Workout constructors

Foundation Run

- Inputs Needed: duration_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Run for {duration_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Effort should be easy and conversational.
- Guardrails: Heart Rate MUST NOT exceed the top of Zone 2. Perceived Effort must remain 4/10 or lower.
- Variations: Can be substituted with a cross-training session of equal duration.

Recovery Run

- Inputs Needed: duration_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Run for {duration_minutes} at very Low Intensity (Zone 1).
  2. Effort must feel extremely easy.
- Guardrails: This is the lowest intensity run type. Heart Rate MUST remain in Zone 1. Perceived Effort must not exceed 2/10.
- Variations: Can be substituted with a cross-training session of equal duration and intensity.

Long Run

- Inputs Needed: duration_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Run for {duration_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 2).
- Guardrails: Pace should be steady and conversational. Avoid intensity creep, especially in the later stages of the run.
- Variations: Can be modified to include segments of higher intensity, creating workouts like "Long Run with Speed Play" or "Long Run with Fast Finish."

Speed Play Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, main_set_duration_minutes, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Run for {main_set_duration_minutes}, alternating between Low Intensity (Zone 2) and short, unstructured bursts of High Intensity (Zone 4-5) running by feel.
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: High-intensity portions are informal and should not be all-out sprints. The goal is to elevate heart rate and pace playfully, not to perform a structured interval session.

Hill Repetition Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, num_reps, hill_effort_seconds, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2) on flat terrain.
  2. Main Set: Find a moderate hill. Repeat {num_reps} times: (Run uphill for {hill_effort_seconds} at High Intensity (RPE 8-9) -> Jog/walk slowly down the hill for full recovery).
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2) on flat terrain.
- Guardrails: INTENSITY TARGET: Perceived Effort (RPE). Pace is not a valid metric for this workout. Recovery is the full duration of the slow jog/walk back to the start. The runner must feel ready before beginning the next repetition.

Short Interval Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, num_reps, interval_distance_meters, recovery_distance_meters, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Repeat {num_reps} times: (Run {interval_distance_meters} at High Intensity (Zone 5) -> Recover for {recovery_distance_meters} at Low Intensity (Zone 1)).
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: INTENSITY TARGET: Pace or RPE. Heart Rate will lag and is not a reliable real-time guide for the work interval. Full recovery between repetitions is essential for maintaining quality.

Long Interval Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, num_reps, interval_distance_meters, recovery_distance_meters, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Repeat {num_reps} times: (Run {interval_distance_meters} at High Intensity (Zone 4) -> Recover for {recovery_distance_meters} at Low Intensity (Zone 1)).
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: The primary intensity guide for the 'Run' portion is Pace or RPE. Heart Rate will lag. The 'Recover' portion MUST be a true, slow jog or walk; failure to recover adequately will compromise the quality of subsequent intervals.

Mixed Interval Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, main_set_structure (list of interval/recovery pairs), cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Execute the sequence defined in {main_set_structure}. Example: [Run 1600m @ Z4, Recover 400m @ Z1], [Run 800m @ Z5, Recover 400m @ Z1], [Run 400m @ Z5, Recover 200m @ Z1].
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: Pay close attention to the prescribed intensity zone for each interval, as they may vary. Adhere strictly to recovery periods.

Tempo Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, tempo_duration_minutes, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Run continuously for {tempo_duration_minutes} at Moderate Intensity (Zone 3).
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: Intensity is "comfortably hard." The goal is to sustain a steady effort at or just below lactate threshold, not to push into high intensity.

Cruise Interval Run

- Inputs Needed: warmup_minutes, num_reps, interval_duration_minutes OR interval_distance_meters, recovery_duration_minutes, cooldown_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Warm-up: Run for {warmup_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
  2. Main Set: Repeat {num_reps} times: (Run {interval_duration_minutes} or {interval_distance_meters} at Moderate Intensity (Zone 3) -> Recover for {recovery_duration_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1)).
  3. Cool-down: Run for {cooldown_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 1-2).
- Guardrails: Unlike tempo runs, this workout breaks the moderate-intensity effort into segments. Recovery periods are short and should be active (slow jog).

Fast Finish Run

- Inputs Needed: low_intensity_duration_minutes, moderate_intensity_duration_minutes
- Step-by-step Template:
  1. Run for {low_intensity_duration_minutes} at Low Intensity (Zone 2).
  2. Immediately transition to running for {moderate_intensity_duration_minutes} at Moderate Intensity (Zone 3).
- Guardrails: The final segment is a sustained tempo effort, not an all-out sprint. Avoid pushing into the high-intensity zone.

5. Week/season structure

- Training Phases:
  - Base Phase: The primary goal of this phase is to build a strong and deep aerobic foundation. It is characterized by the highest proportion of low-intensity volume, often 85-90% of total training time. Quality sessions focus on developing foundational speed and strength through workouts like Hill Repetitions and informal Speed Play, which build power and neuromuscular coordination without the high physiological strain of race-specific intervals.
  - Peak Phase: The goal of this phase is to build race-specific fitness upon the foundation established in the base phase. This phase transitions from foundational speed to race-specific endurance. Workouts become more structured and are designed to mimic the demands of the goal race, such as sustained Tempo Runs for marathoners or VO2max-focused Long Intervals for 5K runners. This phase sees an increase in the proportion of moderate-to-high intensity training, bringing the weekly balance closer to the 80/20 ideal (or slightly higher, up to ~77/23).
  - Taper Phase: The goal of the taper is to shed cumulative fatigue while retaining fitness, ensuring the runner is fresh and sharp for race day. This phase, typically lasting one to two weeks, is characterized by a significant reduction in overall training volume, achieved primarily by shortening low-intensity runs. While the frequency of quality sessions may be maintained, their volume is typically reduced to facilitate recovery (e.g., fewer repetitions in an interval session).
- Weekly Principles:
  - "Quality sessions"—any run containing moderate or high intensity—should be limited to two per week for most athletes. Advanced runners may occasionally handle three.
  - Quality sessions must be separated by at least one low-intensity day (e.g., a Foundation or Recovery Run) to allow for adequate physiological and neurological recovery.
  - A typical weekly structure consists of one designated Long Run, one or two quality sessions, and two to four Foundation or Recovery runs to complete the schedule while maintaining the 80/20 intensity balance.
