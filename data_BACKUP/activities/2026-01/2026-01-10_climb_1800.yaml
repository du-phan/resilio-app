description: "Session with friends at Arkose Strasbourg Saint Denis ! It has been\
  \ a while since my last time here so everything is new. The right ankle is stilla\
  \ bit fragile as usual so I don't try hard to avoid to many falls.\r\n\r\nOverall\
  \ feeling quite good, do some red level boulders so I'm satistfied:\r\n* Flash a\
  \ red level 1/5  (#physical: core) \r\n* Flash a red level 3/5 (#grip strength:\
  \ slope, #physical: core)\r\n* Top a red level 1/5 after two attempts (#physical:\
  \ core)\r\n* Top a red 5/5 after 3+ attempts  (#grip strength: pinch, #physical:\
  \ upper body)\r\n\r\nThe right ankle feeling a bit sensitive after the session (very\
  \ light pain on level 1 or 2/10, more like dis comfort, but still it is not great\
  \ great )"
