description: "Yin yoga: focus on hip flexor and hamstring stretches.\r\nI was supposed\
  \ to go bouldering tonight, but the right ankle is still feeling not that great\
  \ (still sensitive and a bit uncomfort since the run yesterday, pain on a scale\
  \ of 1.5/10 but it is not going away), and I was not feeling super motivated (because\
  \ in fact I could have done a bouldering training session only on hangboard without\
  \ using the feet), so yoga instead."
