description: 6 x 1000m @10k pace 75s rest
private_note: "My 10 pace is around 4:55-5:00 min/km.\r\nIn the first lap (the first\
  \ 1000m), the gps was not working so I feel like I was running much faster than\
  \ the goal pace.\r\nNot an easy session evidently but manageable, not very hard.\
  \ At the end I felt some tension and slight tightness in the front of my hip, right\
  \ where the thigh connects to the pelvis \u2014 around the hip flexor area, especially\
  \ in the left side. It\u2019s more noticeable when I lift my leg or stretch the\
  \ front of the hip. I notice that yesterday and this morning too (but with less\
  \ intensity) so it is not 100% because of the running but it can be attribute to\
  \ my bouldering stretching/training too.\r\nOverall, ok session, especially after\
  \ the drinks last night (750ml of beer). I went to bed a bit late (I got home at\
  \ around 11pm but then geeked around a bit and  slept around 1:00 am) and woke up\
  \ at 9am, feeling ok but the garmin watch gave a quite bad sleep score . "
