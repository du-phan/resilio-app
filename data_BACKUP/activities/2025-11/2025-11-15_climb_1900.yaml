description: "I succeeded the red level 4/5 of traversal type that I failed last time\
  \ on first try! This time I start the session with it so I was quite fresh. That's\
  \ the highlight of the session. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is a hard-boulder-only session:\
  \ so i worked exclusively on black level. Made some progress on several ones. Hopefully\
  \ I will be able to top them.  \r\n\r\nOn a downside note, I felt a slight pinch\
  \ in my left shoulder \u2014 probably nothing, but I need to be careful."
