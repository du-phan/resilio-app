description: "At home gym Arkose Montmartre. \r\nI flashed a black-level boulder (grade\
  \ black 1/5): in slight overhang with some powerful move.  It is my style but objectively\
  \ it is still a very easy, I'd rather grade it red 3/5.\r\nThen I work on another\
  \ black-level boulder (grade black 2/5): I spent at least 1h on it to work on the\
  \ crux, which, imo, is a bit morphological: it is harder for shorter climber like\
  \ me. I should be able to do it in the next sessions though.\r\nFinally I work on\
  \ a red 4/5 traversal style: I did not succeed as I'm already quite tired and this\
  \ boulder is quite physical, especially for shorter climber (again).\r\nIn general,\
  \ I feel quite  good, quite physical (and a bit longer than usual) session. "
