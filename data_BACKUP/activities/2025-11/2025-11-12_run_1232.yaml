description: "8 x 600m @3k pace 75s rest\r\n\r\n/tool_creation: create a new tool\
  \ if not exist called `historical workout pattern matching`: the goal is to find\
  \ all \"similar\" workouts in the past (for example for this specific one, look\
  \ for all the workouts type X x 600m at around the same pace). Then based on your\
  \ expertise, retrieve or compute all the important metrics allowing you to adjust\
  \ the training plan (HR, VMA, etc.). Add these inputs into the tool `Training plan\
  \ adaptation`. Then update the system prompt. Think ultrahard, step by step. Be\
  \ rigorous and thorough. Always plan before act."
private_note: "My 3k pace is around 4:30 - 4:35 min/km\r\nNot an easy one, definitely\
  \ tougher than the 6 x 1000m  @10k pace last week. As usual it is the first few\
  \ laps that I ran the slowest, psychological issue I guess. \r\n"
