description: "Quick session at Arkose Chevaleret. Last time I was here is about a\
  \ few weeks ago I guess, so half of the boulders have changed, a good thing.\r\n\
  \r\nI focus on the new reds as usual. Results:\r\n* Flash: 4\r\n* Succeed in 2-3\
  \ attempts: 1\r\n* Succeed after 4+ attempts: 1 (dynamic moves)\r\n* Failures: 2\
  \ (1 is a dynamic move so I need to try more, another one is a quite physical one\
  \ with a crux is 2 small crimps, I should be able to do both next time).\r\n\r\n\
  Overall sensation: okish. I don't climb often at lunch, so I feel that the energy\
  \ is not high (I ate a small energy bar 30 minutes before). "
