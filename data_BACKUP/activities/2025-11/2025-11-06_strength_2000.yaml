description: "Back to the home gym, arkose montmartre ! \r\nIt has been a while, so\
  \ there are quite several new walls. I focus mainly on the new reds. Here is the\
  \ results:\r\n* Flashed: 2 (both red level 3/5 according to arkose grades) \r\n\
  * Succeeded in 2-3 attempts: 0\r\n* Succeeded in 4+ attempts: 1 slab/small hold\
  \ (level red 3/5), 1 tough one with a nice heel sit but that was probably not the\
  \ beta (level red 3/5) and another slab on volume (level red 2/5).\r\n* Failure:\
  \ 2 (level res 4/5 but there is one that feel harder and a bit morpho)\r\n\r\nFeeling\
  \ ok! "
