description: "A session in Arkose Strasbourg Saint Denis with friends ! It is my second\
  \ time here, the first time was year ago, so evrryhing is new. As usually I focus\
  \ on the red level:\n* Flashed: \n* Succeeded in 2-3 attempts\n* Succeeded in 4+\
  \ attempts\n\nIn general, feeling ok. Did not sleep that much last night so I took\
  \ a nap this afternoon but it doesn't help that much... "
