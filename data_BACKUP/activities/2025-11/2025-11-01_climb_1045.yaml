description: "Small session with friend in Arkose Montreuil ! \r\nIt has been a long\
  \ time that I did not come back to this gym so everything is new. \r\nI mostly stayed\
  \ with my friend who is a bit less strong than me so it is quite a chill session.\
  \ We mainly focus on Red 2 boulders, which is quite under my max level: I flashed\
  \ 4 of them and succeeded the others with in less than 3 attempts. Given that at\
  \ Arkose Montmartre (my home gym) my \"comfortable\" grade is around Red 3-4, this\
  \ is expected, even though I think in Montreuil the level is a bit harder than in\
  \ Montmartre. \r\n\r\nOverall good sensation, but we did not have much time so I\
  \ did not manage to try harder boulders."
