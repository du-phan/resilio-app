description: "A session with friends at Climbing district Jaur\xE8s. It has been a\
  \ while since I come back here so everything is new. The difficulty level here is\
  \ a bit like arkose: yellow, green, blue, red, black, and white. \r\n\r\nUsually\
  \ the red ones are quite at the same level as arkose's red boulders, so at my level\
  \ (not easy but not usually \"project\" level hard neither) . However this time\
  \ I feel like they are much easier than usual, my results below illustrate that:\
  \ I flashed most of them. Certainly I have progressed a bit since last time but\
  \ not that much. \r\n\r\nRed boulders result (I climbed solely on this level in\
  \ this session) : \r\n\u2022 Flash: 9\r\n\u2022 succeed in 2-3 attempts: 1\r\n\u2022\
  \ succeed in 4+ attempts: 1\r\n\u2022 Failure: 2\r\n\r\nOverall good sensation too.\
  \ A good sleep last night helps I guess, even though I had a bit of runny nose just\
  \ before the session, feeling good during the climb."
