description: "Test another new boulder gym in Lyon: MRoc! \nThere are only 5 levels:\
  \ green, blue, purple,red and black.\n\nThe level is quite hard and quite interesting.\
  \ Still quite crimpy old school but there are cool movements too.\n\nI warm up on\
  \ green and blue. Blue here is definitely harder than the blue in arkose. \n\nMost\
  \ of the purple are like red 4+ at arkose, so quite hard to do in one session. I\
  \ focus on the purple the whole session, below is the result: \nPurple\n\n\u2022\
  \ Flash: 1\n\u2022 succeed in 2-3 attempts: 1\n\u2022 succeed in 4+ attempts:\_\
  \ 0\n\u2022 Failures:\_ a hard slab with a dynamic move near the end that I can\
  \ succeed if I try many times ( already spent like at least 5 attempts to succeed\
  \ the first part). 1 nearly there but lack energy for the final move .\_ 6 others\
  \ with very few attempts (less than 5)\n\nGood sensation in general, it's always\
  \ hard to try very hard in a new gym as you want to try many boulders, you are not\
  \ used to the holds and the style, but it was still a good session! \n"
