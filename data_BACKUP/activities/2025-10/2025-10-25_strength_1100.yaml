description: "First session ever at Block Session in Lyon!\nGood sensation and because\
  \ it is a new gym I just want to climb as much as possible so I did not try super\
  \ hard boulder.\nThe level is ( in french): D\xE9butant, facile, moyen, tr\xE8s\
  \ difficile,  extr\xEAme, mutant.\n\nI warm up on intermediate (moyen) level then\
  \ climb solely on the difficile level. Below is the result of all th\xE9 difficile\
  \ level boulders that I climbed: \n\n\u2022 Flash : 2\n\u2022 2-3 tries: 7\n\u2022\
  \ 4+ tries: 3\n\nI'd say in term of difficulty , the \"difficile\" level is around\
  \ red 3 and below at arkose Montmartre (my hom gym). So I'd say I could have climbed\
  \ their \"tr\xE8s difficile\" level too, but with site some attempts and effort.\
  \ \n\nOverall good sensation ! The style is quite crimpy old school, so not quite\
  \ my style but the boulders are great. \n\n"
