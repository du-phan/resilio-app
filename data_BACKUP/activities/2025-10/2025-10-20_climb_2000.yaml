description: Still a bit low energy and it's super hot in the gym so just a small
  session. Still a new red problem down though, but quite an easy one. I also redid
  the black problem of last time with success at first try so it's good. Try the half
  end of the black 4 problem and succeed so that's good too. Overall quite ok short
  session.
